      <title>Enhancement of quantitative contrast by place as fortition</title>

      <description>(Poster presentation)
In this paper I consider multiple cases where a consonant quantity contrast is enhanced by place specifications. Focusing on coronal non-glide sonorants, I argue that this process should be analysed as the counterpart of manner changes that are involved in the fortition of glides, as described by Bybee &amp;amp; Easterday (2019).
I consider several cases where a historical distinction between short and long (singleton and geminate) sonorants, especially laterals and coronal nasals, and in some cases also rhotics, is reflected as a qualitative distinction, usually involving place.</description>

      <title>Length in strange places</title>

      <description>(Poster presentations)
Present-day Celtic languages are characterized by a typologically relatively unusual contrast between &amp;ldquo;lenis&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;fortis&amp;rdquo; coronal sonorants. It is especially developed in the Gaelic languages. Here, &amp;ldquo;fortis&amp;rdquo; nn ll rr contrast with &amp;ldquo;lenis&amp;rdquo; l n r in postvocalic position (Irish geal &amp;lsquo;bright&amp;rsquo; vs. geall &amp;lsquo;promise&amp;rsquo;). Furthermore, they participate in the initial mutation system, where the &amp;ldquo;fortis&amp;rdquo; sonorants generally occur in the unmutated (&amp;ldquo;radical&amp;rdquo;) grade, and &amp;ldquo;lenis&amp;rdquo; ones in the &amp;ldquo;lenited&amp;rdquo; grade, which historically corresponds to postvocalic contexts.</description>

      <title>Length and quantity in Romance</title>

      <description>In this chapter we consider the phonological status and patterning of vowel and consonant length and syllabic quantity across Romance varieties. The chapter is divided into two parts. In the first section, we provide an overview of the status of vowel and consonant length in the modern Romance varieties and describe the diachronic context. Synchronically, the presence of a phonemic contrast between short and long vowels is characteristic particularly of Gallo-Romance (including the varieties of northern Italy and Alpine Romance); some kind of distinction between short and long vowels and/or consonants (not necessarily one with phonemic significance) is found in a broader range of varieties, primarily in Italy.</description>

      <title>Rule scattering and vowel length in Northern Romance</title>
      <link>https://www.anghyflawn.net/writing/rule-scattering-vowel-length-northern-romance/</link>

      <description>In this paper I reconsider the synchronic status of distinctive vowel length and vowel lengthening and shortening rules in Northern Romance varieties, in light of Loporcaro’s (2015) wide-ranging study of vowel quantity in numerous Romance dialects. Loporcaro (2015) argues that these varieties possess distinctive, phonemic vowel length, and mostly do not have synchronic rules that produce surface long vowels, contrary to many previous analyses of the relevant patterns. In this paper, I argue instead that that lexical vowel length distinctions coexist, in some Northern Romance varieties, with productive phonological rules manipulating vowel quantity.</description>

      <title>Final devoicing and vowel lengthening in Friulian</title>
      <link>https://www.anghyflawn.net/writing/lingua-friulian/</link>

      <description>Here, I propose an analysis of the interacting between final devoicing and vowel lengthening in Friulian (and other related varieties of northern Italy). Historically, stressed vowels lengthen before voiced obstruents, but this is opacified by final devoicing. I capitalize on phonetic studies showing final devoicing in the language to be incomplete and argue that the process is not in fact opaque: devoicing does not involve neutralization but instead the creation of a third, laryngealy unspecified class of obstruents.</description>

      <description>I propose an analysis of the interaction between vowel lengthening before voiced obstruents and final devoicing in two languages: Friulian and Breton. I argue that such interactions are transparent and involve a three-way laryngeal contrast formalized geometrically, with true voiceless obstruents the most structurally complex and devoiced ones least. The Friulian analysis was later published here and the Breton was largely incorporated into the thesis.</description>
