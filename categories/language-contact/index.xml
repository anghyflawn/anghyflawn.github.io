<description>&lt;p&gt;In this talk I attempt to extend Nigel Duffield&amp;rsquo;s idea of &amp;lsquo;lexicalized heads&amp;rsquo; playing a rôle in the triggering of initial mutations, originally proposed for Irish, to Welsh.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Initial consonant mutation and information flow in Mende</title>
<link>http://anghyflawn.github.io/presentation/2008/ocp5/</link>

<description>&lt;p&gt;I reanalyse the pattern of initial consonant mutation in Mende by arguing that the so-called &amp;lsquo;weak&amp;rsquo; grade, usually assumed to be the derive one, is the default case morphosyntactically, and thus that the consonant mutation mechanism must derive the &amp;lsquo;strong&amp;rsquo; rather than the &amp;lsquo;weak&amp;rsquo; grade. This is problematic for autosegmental, or probably any purely phonological, accounts of mutation, since the relationship between the weak and strong grades is one-to-many, so I suggest the choice between the two grades is made outside of phonology, with direct reference to the morphosyntax.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The phonology and morphosyntax of Breton mutation</title>

<guid>http://anghyflawn.github.io/writing/breton-mutation/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I analyse of initial consonant mutation in a Breton dialect, with a
focus on establishing the division of labour between phonology and
morphology in the triggering of mutation and its phonological
expression. I argue that different types of mutation have different
status in the grammar: some are purely phonological, others involve
subsegmental morphemes with a clear morphosyntactic rationale, and for
some the phonological aspects are clear but the morphosyntactic
motivation remains obscure. In addition, the differences among the
types of mutation support a stratal model of morphology-phonology
interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;In this talk I suggest that some cases of the historical extension of initial mutation in Welsh to some contexts where they are not explainable with reference to sandhi in Proto-Brythonic, such as the &amp;lsquo;direct object mutation&amp;rsquo;, may have been driven by the interpretation of lenition (&amp;lsquo;soft mutation&amp;rsquo;) as a non-prototypicality marker.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;This talk was an attempt at documenting initial consonant mutations in as wide a range of languages as possible, together with an attempt at a typology. It formed the basis for the &lt;a href=&#34;http://anghyflawn.github.io/writing/rara/&#34;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; published in the proceedings of the conference.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Brythonic ‘second lenition’ revisited</title>

<guid>http://anghyflawn.github.io/presentation/2006/celto-slavica/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In this talk I evaluate the arguments for two competing reconstructions regarding the laryngeal phonology of Proto-Brythonic. I defend the &amp;lsquo;new&amp;rsquo; interpretation which underplays the role of a &amp;lsquo;fortis&amp;rsquo; contrast and instead relies on two separate lenition processes (due to authors such as David Greene and Patrick Sims-Williams), against the &amp;lsquo;classical&amp;rsquo; one due to Kenneth Jackson and defended by John Koch and Graham Isaac, which emphasizes the rôle of aspiration in Proto-Brythonic &amp;lsquo;voiceless&amp;rsquo; stops. In many respects this talk does not really represent my current thinking, but some of the arguments seem to me to retain some value.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Liquids and spirants</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;Here, I consider some cases of fricatives phonologically patterning with liquids, and argue that this phenomenon is merely the extension of the well-known cross-linguistic diversity in the representation of the former. I interpret this as providing support for substance-free representations with a non-trivial phonology-phonetics mapping. I provide a concrete analysis of initial mutations involving sonorants in Scottish Gaelic.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Getting ESS and AUCTeX to play nicely with knitr</title>
<link>http://anghyflawn.github.io/blog/2014/getting-ess-and-auctex-to-play-nicely-with-knitr/</link>
<pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
<guid>http://anghyflawn.github.io/blog/2014/getting-ess-and-auctex-to-play-nicely-with-knitr/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Although my job title is &amp;lsquo;Lecturer in Theoretical Phonology&amp;rsquo; (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/pavel-iosad(976edf38-f950-4179-a032-a6cea4b31b3b.html&#34;&gt;no, really&lt;/a&gt;), I&amp;rsquo;ve been getting into more empirical work. I went on a data collection trip to South Wales in February to work with Welsh, and only early this week we had two great days collecting Gaelic data in North Argyll – not an area &lt;em&gt;readily&lt;/em&gt; associated with Gaelic these days, but in fact we found quite a few very good speakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this post isn&amp;rsquo;t about that. Having collected the data and processed some of it, I have also been getting to grips with &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; doing statistical analysis (as opposed to working through textbooks), which these days inevitably means &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.r-project.org.&#34;&gt;R&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m giving a couple of talks in Wales next week (&lt;a href=&#34;http://privatewww.essex.ac.uk/~wss/wss-21.htm&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://amrywiaeth.wordpress.com&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) with some of the results, so the time had come for me to think about getting my data into my presentations (and eventually papers). Being a LaTeX user, after some poking about I settled on &lt;a href=&#34;http://yihui.name/knitr&#34;&gt;knitr&lt;/a&gt; as the way to get stuff out of R and into LaTeX.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the R wizards I know use &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rstudio.com&#34;&gt;RStudio&lt;/a&gt;, which is a very good IDE for R, but doesn&amp;rsquo;t come close to the power of Emacs with AUCTeX for LaTeX writing. So far I have found &lt;a href=&#34;http://ess.r-studio.org&#34;&gt;ESS&lt;/a&gt; to be perfectly adequare for my R needs. ESS also supports knitting &lt;code&gt;.Rnw&lt;/code&gt; files out of the box via &lt;code&gt;M-n r&lt;/code&gt;. Its default weaving engine, however, is Sweave. After some poking about, here&amp;rsquo;s how to get ESS and AUCTeX to play nicely with knitr.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two components. One is to make knitr the default engine when tangling outside AUCTeX. This is easily achieved via &lt;code&gt;(setq ess-swv-processor &#39;knitr)&lt;/code&gt; in your &lt;code&gt;init.el&lt;/code&gt;, but this only allows you to use knitr as the default when you tangle via &lt;code&gt;M-n T&lt;/code&gt;. What this doesn&amp;rsquo;t automate is running LaTeX on the product of the knitting: you have to switch to the &lt;code&gt;.tex&lt;/code&gt; file manually and run stuff from there, but this runs the risk of making edits to the &lt;code&gt;.tex&lt;/code&gt; file instead of the &lt;code&gt;.Rnw&lt;/code&gt;. ESS also has a &lt;code&gt;latex&lt;/code&gt; tangling option (&lt;code&gt;M-n l&lt;/code&gt;), but this just runs &lt;code&gt;latex&lt;/code&gt; from the shell, without any of the AUCTeX customizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ESS also has the option to plug into AUCTeX, making relevant commands available to the user via &lt;code&gt;C-c C-c&lt;/code&gt;. This is much handier, but unfortunately the functions which add these commands are hardcoded to use Sweave from the shell rather than &lt;code&gt;ess-swv-run-in-R&lt;/code&gt;, which is sensitive to the value of &lt;code&gt;ess-swv-processor&lt;/code&gt;. So here&amp;rsquo;s what you need in order to get knitr to run into AUCTeX.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-elisp&#34;&gt;;; somewhere after (require &#39;ess-site)
(setq ess-swv-plug-into-AUCTeX-p t)

(defun ess-swv-add-TeX-commands ()
  &amp;quot;Add commands to AUCTeX&#39;s \\[TeX-command-list].&amp;quot;
  (unless (and (featurep &#39;tex-site) (featurep &#39;tex))
    (error &amp;quot;AUCTeX does not seem to be loaded&amp;quot;))
  (add-to-list &#39;TeX-command-list
               &#39;(&amp;quot;Knit&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Rscript -e \&amp;quot;library(knitr); knit(&#39;%t&#39;)\&amp;quot;&amp;quot;
                 TeX-run-command nil (latex-mode) :help
                 &amp;quot;Run Knitr&amp;quot;) t)
  (add-to-list &#39;TeX-command-list
               &#39;(&amp;quot;LaTeXKnit&amp;quot; &amp;quot;%l %(mode) %s&amp;quot;
                 TeX-run-TeX nil (latex-mode) :help
                 &amp;quot;Run LaTeX after Knit&amp;quot;) t)
  (setq TeX-command-default &amp;quot;Knit&amp;quot;)
  (mapc (lambda (suffix)
          (add-to-list &#39;TeX-file-extensions suffix))
        &#39;(&amp;quot;nw&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Snw&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Rnw&amp;quot;)))

(defun ess-swv-remove-TeX-commands (x)
  &amp;quot;Helper function: check if car of X is one of the Knitr strings&amp;quot;
  (let ((swv-cmds &#39;(&amp;quot;Knit&amp;quot; &amp;quot;LaTeXKnit&amp;quot;)))
    (unless (member (car x) swv-cmds) x)))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are just little changes to the original functions defined in &lt;code&gt;ess-swv.el&lt;/code&gt;. Now you can, via &lt;code&gt;C-c C-c&lt;/code&gt;, access &lt;code&gt;Knit&lt;/code&gt; (which just produces the &lt;code&gt;.tex&lt;/code&gt; file) and &lt;code&gt;LaTeXKnit&lt;/code&gt;, which runs the LaTeX process as customized by AUCTeX (e.g. to use XeTeX or whatever other options you normally use) on the output, without you having to go the &lt;code&gt;.tex&lt;/code&gt; file. Which is nice.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Norsemen in Scotland: A linguistic view, part 1</title>
<link>http://anghyflawn.github.io/blog/2014/norsemen-in-scotland-a-linguistic-view-part-1/</link>
<pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
<guid>http://anghyflawn.github.io/blog/2014/norsemen-in-scotland-a-linguistic-view-part-1/</guid>
<description>

&lt;p&gt;It is quite common knowledge that the history of English has been significantly influenced by the settlement of North Germanic speakers in the north-eastern part of what is now England. From relatively trivial words like &lt;em&gt;skirt&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;window&lt;/em&gt; to the less commonly borrowed items like &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; and all the way to the general simplification of the Old English system of inflections (e.g. case in nouns) in the Middle English period: you name it, the Vikings have been blamed for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, I&amp;rsquo;d like to explore another part of the Norse influence on the language landscape of the British Isles: their impact on Scotland. Again, it is commonly acknowledged that the Norsemen are part of the cultural and linguistic mix that produced the Scottish nation as we know it. This is probably most obvious in the Northern Isles, where the &lt;a href=&#34;http://nornlanguage.x10.mx/&#34;&gt;Norn language&lt;/a&gt;, whose closest relatives are found in the west of Norway, on the Faroe Islands, and in Iceland, perisisted for about the same length of time as Cornish did in the south-west of Britain; but the Nordic linguistic heritage in Gaelic Scotland is also considerable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;History, archaeology, and literary sources all bear out a significant Norse presence in the Hebrides and around most of the Irish Sea. For some parts of this region the historical record is (relatively) abundant – this is, of course, not surprising in view of the strength of the chronicle tradition in Ireland; for one recent overview of the region, see &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oxbowbooks.com/oxbow/vikings-of-the-irish-sea.html&#34;&gt;David Griffiths&amp;rsquo; &lt;em&gt;Vikings of the Irish Sea&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. For others, this historical record is much sparser – and the Hebrides, today&amp;rsquo;s Gaelic heartland, are a case in point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;linguistic-connections:e3fd371520faab08220affae68c8a354&#34;&gt;Linguistic connections&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of linguistic evidence to tease out unrecorded contacts between populations has a long and venerable history. Very often this takes the form of the search for a &lt;em&gt;substrate&lt;/em&gt; – a language whose users shift to a different one but which ends up influencing their version of the &amp;lsquo;new&amp;rsquo; variety. Notable examples of substrate theories include the suggestion, going back at least to &lt;a href=&#34;http://wbo.llgc.org.uk/en/s-MORR-JOH-1864.html&#34;&gt;John Morris-Jones&lt;/a&gt;, that the Celtic languages have a &amp;lsquo;Hamito-Semitic&amp;rsquo; substrate, Sigmund Feist&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_substrate_hypothesis&#34;&gt;proposed pre-Germanic language&lt;/a&gt;, or Theo Vennemann&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasconic_substratum_theory&#34;&gt;Vasconic effort&lt;/a&gt;. In all of these cases, certain features of the modern languages are surmised to be borrowings, but the problem is that while the linguistic conclusions may or may not be sound, depending on one&amp;rsquo;s standard of evidence, the very existence of population contact that would lead to the &amp;lsquo;correct&amp;rsquo; sort of language contact remains largely speculative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A slightly different facet of the same problem is presented by phenomena such as putative Celtic influence on English. Here, the fact of contact is not usually in doubt: there is widespread agreement that incoming Germanic speakers would have encountered a Celtic-speaking population.&lt;a href=&#34;#ftn1&#34; id=&#34;ftn1_source&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Whether this population contact would have led to significant linguistic influence has been the source of much debate, a lot of it helpfully summarized in a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780415266024/&#34;&gt;relatively recent book&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two main issues around the &amp;lsquo;Celtic hypothesis&amp;rsquo;. One is more of a chronological nature: the putative contact features do not really show up until the Middle English period, although people have proposed various ways of dealing with the issue. A second problem is our lack of knowledge about the precise circumstances of the contact, which, as &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Trudgill&#34;&gt;Peter Trudgill&lt;/a&gt; in particular has shown in detail, are crucial to determining the existence and nature of any linguistic contact effects. (For what it&amp;rsquo;s worth, though, Trudgill endorses the Celtic hypothesis in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cambridge.org/gb/academic/subjects/languages-linguistics/sociolinguistics/investigations-sociohistorical-linguistics-stories-colonisation-and-contact&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Investigations in sociohistorical linguistics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – a short and really accessible book that I cannot recommend highly enough.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;e-norvegia-lux:e3fd371520faab08220affae68c8a354&#34;&gt;E Norvegia lux?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about the Norse linguistic influence in Scotland, and more specifically in Gaelic Scotland? In many ways the questions are similar to those posed of the Celtic hypothesis for English: we &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; there was population contact, but we don&amp;rsquo;t really know what sort of contact it was, and the chronology doesn&amp;rsquo;t square up very nicely. Yet there are also interesting, if maybe subtle, differences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of early descriptive work on the living Celtic varieties happened to be carried out by Nordic, and particularly Norwegian scholars. The &amp;lsquo;grand old man&amp;rsquo; of Celtic studies in Norway was &lt;a href=&#34;https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Marstrander&#34;&gt;Carl Marstrander&lt;/a&gt;. He trained as an Indo-Europeanist under Sophus Bugge and Alf Torp. Although some of his early work concerned the historical and linguistic aspects of Norse settlement in the British Isles seen from the Nordic perspective (as in &lt;em&gt;Bidrag til det norske Sprogs Historie i Irland&lt;/em&gt; [Contributions to the History of the Norwegian Language in Ireland], published 1915), he was also a pioneer in the documentation of the living Celtic languages, having worked on the Blasket Islands with Tomás Ó Criomhthain of &lt;a href=&#34;https://wikisource.org/wiki/An_t-Oile%C3%A1nach&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;An t-Oileánach&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; fame and on the Isle of Man. Among his disciples were Carl Borgstrøm (author of several descriptions of Scottish Gaelic dialects), Alf Sommerfelt, who worked not only on several varieties of (mostly Ulster) Irish but also on Welsh and Breton, and Magne Oftedal (author of what is probably the most comprehensive published description of a Scottish Gaelic dialect, &lt;em&gt;The Gaelic of Leurbost, Isle of Lewis&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these scholars had a background not just in Celtic studies but also in the Nordic philological and dialectological traditions (for instance, Oftedal&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://ask.bibsys.no/ask/action/show?pid=031890482&amp;amp;kid=biblio&#34;&gt;dissertation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Ordstrukturen i Gjestalmålet&lt;/em&gt; was a phonological description of the dialect of Gjesdal in south-west Norway). With this sort of history, it is not really surprising that they would get onto the case of some striking linguistic similarities between Nordic and Gaelic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marstrander was probably the first to draw attention to these, in &lt;em&gt;Okklusiver og substrater&lt;/em&gt; [Stops and substrates], published in the 1932 issue of &lt;em&gt;Norsk tidsskrift for sprogvidenskap&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Norwegian Journal of Linguistics&lt;/em&gt;); his theories received support from Oftedal (&lt;em&gt;Jærske okklusivar&lt;/em&gt; [Jæren stops], also in NTS, 1946) and were elaborated and extended by Borgstrøm (&lt;em&gt;The influence of Norse on Scottish Gaelic&lt;/em&gt;, 1974).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three key areas where Norse influence on Gaelic has been claimed to be most evident: the lexicon (i.e. loanwords), the pronunciation of voiceless stops (&lt;em&gt;p t k&lt;/em&gt;), especially in the middle of words, and the use of pitch to distinguish between otherwise identical words. The similarities between Norse and Gaelic in all these domains are indeed quite striking. We will consider especially the latter two in the next posts of this series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;notes:e3fd371520faab08220affae68c8a354&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#ftn1_source&#34; id=&#34;ftn1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Dissenting opinions do exist: the Celticist Peter Schrijver has &lt;a href=&#34;http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1360674309002986&#34;&gt;proposed&lt;/a&gt; that the locals in question would be Latin rather than Celtic speakers. It also seems to me that if Guy Halsall&amp;rsquo;s proposals in the excellently thought-provoking (to this non-medievalist, non-historian) &lt;a href=&#34;http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199658176.do&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Worlds of Arthur&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are on the right track, then this picture may need to be revised as well.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Teaching slides with pandoc and reveal.js</title>

<description>

&lt;p&gt;This past semester I taught a new course entitled &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/14-15/dpt/cxlasc10088.htm&#34;&gt;Phonological Theory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Apart from the content, I decided to experiment a bit with the technical details, specifically using &lt;a href=&#34;http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc&#34;&gt;pandoc&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;reveal.js&#34;&gt;reveal.js&lt;/a&gt; to do the slides and lecture notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a pretty consistent LaTeX user, so to the extent I do slides I do them in &lt;code&gt;beamer&lt;/code&gt;. There is nothing inherently problematic with this, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/&#34;&gt;AUCTeX&lt;/a&gt; saves typing a lot of the boilerplate, but writing two–three presentations per week is still time-consuming. I also tend to do the non-recommended thing and put a lot of text on my slides; my justification (apart from the fact that it lets me pace the lectures at least the first time around) is that I use &lt;code&gt;beamerarticle&lt;/code&gt; to produce a more text-like notes document that is then quite detailed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why pandoc? Well, partly just for the fun of it. My slides + notes workflow also fits quite well with its philosophy of producing multiple output formats from a single input. Perhaps most importantly, markdown is obviously less &amp;lsquo;noisy&amp;rsquo; than LaTeX. Compare this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-markdown&#34;&gt;## Slide title ##

* Item 1
* Item 2
    * Subitem 1
    * Subitem 2
* Item 3
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-latex&#34;&gt;\begin{frame}{Slide title}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Item 1
  \item Item 2
  \begin{itemize}
      \item Subitem 1
      \item Subitem 2
  \end{itemize}
  \item Item 3
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you&amp;rsquo;re pretty proficient in LaTeX and filter out the visual noise, I think it&amp;rsquo;s pretty obvious that the former is a bit less horrible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I&amp;rsquo;ve now taught the entire course using this workflow, and overall I think I was quite happy with it. The workflow carries over nicely and although there were things that took a bit more work than they would have done if I were using LaTeX I think I felt at least as productive when using pandoc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-good:b7cb6333f64fce53cd91cff316b43a20&#34;&gt;The good&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing markdown is of course a piece of cake. I&amp;rsquo;m using Emacs with &lt;a href=&#34;http://jblevins.org/projects/markdown-mode/&#34;&gt;markdown-mode&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://joostkremers.github.io/pandoc-mode/&#34;&gt;pandoc-mode&lt;/a&gt;, which makes it even easier. Consider the task of indenting a sublist, e.g. making a list item (and all its subitems) into a subitem of something else. In markdown-mode, it&amp;rsquo;s a matter of a single keystroke, while in LaTeX it&amp;rsquo;d involve a whole new environment and possibly other adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The text would usually carry over from slides to notes quite painlessly, so that&amp;rsquo;s good. Pandoc-mode also has a handy feature called a &lt;em&gt;project settings file&lt;/em&gt; which allows you to reuse pandoc settings (e.g. includes, bibliography files, CSL files etc.) across multiple input files – having chosen a single set of options it&amp;rsquo;s easy to use them for all the &lt;code&gt;.md&lt;/code&gt; files in that directory. If, for whatever reason, you need to use a different set of options for an individual document, that&amp;rsquo;s also possible with per-file settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pandoc also gives you a lot of latitude to tweak how the output looks like, since you have full access to the templates it uses to build the output. This means that my lecture notes look pretty much like any other documents I write and don&amp;rsquo;t use the default TeX settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really liked Reveal.js. It looks pretty nice (though see below) and it has some nifty features. Some are perhaps more pretty than really useful, but I though the overview mode and the speaker notes were especially handy (the speaker notes in particular are nice when you don&amp;rsquo;t want to put something on the slide but still have it in the notes).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-less-good-and-some-tips:b7cb6333f64fce53cd91cff316b43a20&#34;&gt;The less good, and some tips&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did run into some issues that needed resolving, although partly they involve just shaking off the LaTeX mentality. An obvious issue is the lack of access to LaTeX macros. Pandoc has support for a subset of TeX maths in non-TeX output, so it is possible to use things like &lt;code&gt;$\rightarrow$&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;$\emptyset$&lt;/code&gt; (which you need a lot in a course like that), but getting a feature matrix (for which you&amp;rsquo;d use some version of &lt;code&gt;array&lt;/code&gt;) is more difficult. Still, it&amp;rsquo;s not as crippling as Word, so that&amp;rsquo;s an advantage already. I didn&amp;rsquo;t really run into a case where there was no way to write what I wanted to write, but I did end up typing out &lt;code&gt;$\rightarrow$&lt;/code&gt; a bit more often than I would have wished. (I should probably just have assigned some keystrokes to the right symbols, but I never got round to it.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Pandoc-mode does come with something called &lt;code&gt;@@&lt;/code&gt;-directives, which can be kicked into a shape resembling TeX macros, but they&amp;rsquo;re still pretty limited and also require more Elisp skills than I could dust off while writing a new course from scratch.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diagrams and drawings are another potentially problematic issue. Thankfully, pandoc comes with the filter facility, and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jgm/pandocfilters/&#34;&gt;example repository&lt;/a&gt; contains a filter that takes TikZ code and feeds it straight into the output when the output is TeX but creates an image file and embeds it if the output is something else. With a little bit of hacking I was able to make it understand environments like &lt;code&gt;forest&lt;/code&gt; (which I recommend for drawing trees) and generally have the pictures assume the desired look and feel. So that&amp;rsquo;s doable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One potential issue that it took me some time to figure out was getting speaker notes to play nicely. Reveal.js presentations can be shown as static files, but then you don&amp;rsquo;t have access to speaker notes. To get the notes, you need to run a local server using some Node.js magic or other. For one thing, this obviously means that you need to lug your laptop around to the lecture and hope it works. More importantly, reveal.js seems to assume your presentation resides in the same folder as the reveal.js files. If you have multiple source and output files in the directory for your course, you probably don&amp;rsquo;t want to clutter it with its js, css and so on, but rather keep it in a separate folder. But this means that when you run &lt;code&gt;grunt serve&lt;/code&gt; from the reveal.js folder, you don&amp;rsquo;t get access to your files. To fix that, you need to go open &lt;code&gt;Gruntfile.js&lt;/code&gt; and find the lines&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-js&#34;&gt;		connect: {
			server: {
				options: {
					port: port,
					base: &#39;.&#39;
				}
			}
		},
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Change the &lt;code&gt;base&lt;/code&gt; option to &lt;code&gt;&#39;../&#39;&lt;/code&gt;, and it will serve files from the directory above reveal.js, which is what you probably want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One feature that I miss in reveal.js is a counterpart to &lt;code&gt;beamer&lt;/code&gt;&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;allowframebreaks&lt;/code&gt; option. It does support manual slide breaking, but that is obviously fragile (not least because the screen in the lecture room doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily have the same proportions as yours, so you don&amp;rsquo;t have a 100% reliable guide to when the slide is overfull). Of course you don&amp;rsquo;t have this problem if you don&amp;rsquo;t put too much text on your slide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final thing that is not so much a problem as a consequence of lack of time for my part is that changing the look and feel of reveal.js beyond the stock themes requires passable CSS skills, and I definitely did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; have time for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion:b7cb6333f64fce53cd91cff316b43a20&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found the pandoc + reveal.js route to be a good alternative to beamer for teaching. I think I&amp;rsquo;ll stick to LaTeX/&lt;code&gt;beamer&lt;/code&gt; rather than pandoc for serious paper-writing, since the loss of the LaTeX power is only partially compensated by the relative ease of markdown, but for teaching I would recommend this alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;This course is part of the pre-Honours sequence in all LEL single Honours degrees, as well as of some joint degrees (in addition to being available as an outside course). Its main aim is to familiarize students with the study of linguistic diversity and the relationship between language typology and theory-building. In &lt;sup&gt;2014&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2015&lt;/sub&gt;, I am responsible for the entire phonology block. We cover the following topics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phonological typology and theory. Universals in phonology; descriptive and analytic universals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Universals of inventory organization; feature theory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Syllable structure. Typology of syllable structures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optimality Theory and its application to syllable structure typology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Government Phonology; restrictiveness in theory-building&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stress; metrical typology; metrical typology in OT&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tone and its typology; austosegmental phonology.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;In this course (co-taught with my colleagues &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/homes/patrick&#34;&gt;Patrick Honeybone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/people/michael-ramsammy&#34;&gt;Michael Ramsammy&lt;/a&gt;) we consider a variety of issues connected to phonological change. Throughout the course, we address questions such as the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do we reconstruct the phonology of past language states?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What types of phonological changes are attested?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can synchronic phonological theory assist us in the study of historical phonology?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What can we learn about the human language faculty by studying historical phonology?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;sup&gt;2014&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2015&lt;/sub&gt;, I cover the following topics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phonological typology and historical phonology (with a focus on consonants)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lenition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Historical phonology and phonological representations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

<title>‘Pitch accent’ and prosodic structure in Scottish Gaelic</title>
<link>http://anghyflawn.github.io/writing/icngl-proceedings/</link>
<pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
<guid>http://anghyflawn.github.io/writing/icngl-proceedings/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper considers the origin of &amp;lsquo;pitch accents&amp;rsquo; in Scottish Gaelic
with a view to evaluating the hypothesis that this feature was
borrowed from North Germanic varieties spoken by Norse settlers in
medieval Scotland. It is shown that the &amp;lsquo;pitch accent&amp;rsquo; system in
Gaelic is tightly bound with metrical structure (more precisely
syllable count), certainly diachronically, and probably (at least in
some varieties) synchronically. Gaelic &amp;lsquo;pitch accent&amp;rsquo; is argued to be
a plausible internal development, parallel to similar phenomena in
other branches of Celtic (specifically in Breton), as well as in
Germanic. This conclusion may appear to undermine the contact
hypothesis, especially in the absence of reliable written sources;
nevertheless, a certain role for Norse-Gaelic contact in the
appearance of the pitch accent system cannot be completely excluded&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Humidity causes complex tones?</title>
<link>http://anghyflawn.github.io/blog/2015/humidity-causes-complex-tones/</link>
<pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
<guid>http://anghyflawn.github.io/blog/2015/humidity-causes-complex-tones/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.koensebregts.nl&#34;&gt;Koen Sebregts&lt;/a&gt;  points out that the title of my post is misleading, since the authors explicitly state they do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; predict humidity to cause complex tones. I&amp;rsquo;ll leave it unchanged as a warning to myself.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a new &amp;lsquo;geophonetics&amp;rsquo; paper out at PNAS this morning &lt;a href=&#34;http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1417413112&#34;&gt;Climate, vocal folds, and tonal languages: Connecting the physiological and geographic dots&lt;/a&gt; by Caleb Everett, Damián Blasi, and Seán Roberts. In a nutshell, the claim, as I understand it, is that since low humidity is inimical to precise manipulation of vocal folds, languages with &amp;lsquo;complex tone&amp;rsquo; (understood as having a more than two-way pitch-based contrast) are unlikely to thrive in regions with low humidity (i.e. hot and arid, and all types of cold). This hypothesis appears to explain the areal patterns in the prevalence of tone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The phonetic component of the argument seems quite sound to me, and I&amp;rsquo;m not really qualified to judge the evolutionary part of this paper in any reasonable way. As a phonologist, there&amp;rsquo;s something that really bothers me though, and that is the almost total lack of critical discussion of what it means to be a tonal language. It&amp;rsquo;s noticeable that the phonological part of the bibliography is really sparse, especially compared to the phonetic part: there&amp;rsquo;s Moira Yip&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Tone&lt;/em&gt; textbook, several large-scale overviews like Maddieson (1978) and Hyman (2001), a couple of tonogenesis citations, and Jonathan Kaye&amp;rsquo;s (1990) textbook cited as an example of the consensus as disputed by the authors. No other work by Larry Hyman, who has published a lot on the typology of &amp;lsquo;tone languages&amp;rsquo;, no discussion of the whole idea of &amp;lsquo;pitch accent&amp;rsquo; and how it relates to tone: the only definition given (p. 2) is &amp;lsquo;phonemic tone, in which pitch is used to contrast lexical meaning&amp;rsquo;. The data sources are &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wals.info&#34;&gt;WALS&lt;/a&gt; and especially the &lt;a href=&#34;http://phonotactics.anu.edu.au/&#34;&gt;ANU phonotactics database&lt;/a&gt;. Both of these sources, while extremely valuable, put a lot of emphasis on documenting &amp;lsquo;diversity&amp;rsquo; and quite a bit less on pinpointing what exactly it is they&amp;rsquo;re talking about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve gone to the ANU database to have a look at what it says about tone in languages I know about. Now I work on fairly &amp;lsquo;boring&amp;rsquo;, European languages, but recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been getting quite interested in the European &amp;lsquo;pitch accent&amp;rsquo; systems, plus I actually know a bit about these languages, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d have a go at a selection. I have to say I wasn&amp;rsquo;t exactly happy with the results. The following list gives the number of tonal contrasts given for that language in the ANU database, and my comments if any.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Celtic

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scots Gaelic: 0. This can&amp;rsquo;t be right; there is a &amp;lsquo;pitch accent&amp;rsquo; or glottalization system in most varieties as far as we know. As a shameless plug, &lt;a href=&#34;http://anghyflawn.github.io/pdf/icngl.paper.pdf&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; is a paper of mine with more references inside.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Welsh: 0. (The pitch system of Welsh is non-trivial, but fair enough.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cornish: 0. (Probably, but how do we know for sure?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manx: 0. (Probably true, but how did it end up somewhere in the Trossachs?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Breton: 0. (Fair enough, although see the paper linked above for some discussion.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;North Germanic

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Danish: 0. Here&amp;rsquo;s a good example of the controversy. Danish has stød, a type of laryngealization. Does it count? Maybe not, but it has been analysed as being tonal (e.g. by Junko Itô &amp;amp; Armin Mester and Tomas Riad), although &lt;a href=&#34;http://dx.doi.org/10.1159/000354640&#34;&gt;reasonable people disagree&lt;/a&gt;. In any case, tonal dialects of Danish &lt;a href=&#34;http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03740463.1990.10411522&#34;&gt;definitely exist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;lsquo;Jysk&amp;rsquo;: 0. (Why not Jutland Danish or the like? Anyway, it has both regular stød and so-called Western Jutland stød, how do we count?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Old Norse: 0. We don&amp;rsquo;t know that! Not zero according to &lt;a href=&#34;http://dx.doi.org/10.1075/dia.15.1.04ria&#34;&gt;Tomas Riad&lt;/a&gt;, anyway. Or see &lt;a href=&#34;http://uni.hi.is/haukurth/doktorsverkefni/&#34;&gt;Haukur Þorgeirsson&amp;rsquo;s dissertation&lt;/a&gt; – OK, it&amp;rsquo;s in Icelandic, but still&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nynorsk: 2. Nynorsk is a written standard&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aurland: 2. Why Aurland specifically? But fair enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trondheim: 2. Does this mean Standard Norwegian as spoken in Trondheim? Well then yes. But all around Trondheim you have dialects with so-called &amp;lsquo;circumflex accent&amp;rsquo;, where apocope creates a tonal contrast in monosyllables (usually absent in North Germanic). Does it count as 2 (after all, there is only ever a two-way contrast in monosyllables vs polysyllables) or 3 (the traditional way of looking at things)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;West Germanic

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limburgish [sic]: 2. OK, so we count pitch accents as tones. But many people have argued that it&amp;rsquo;s not a &lt;em&gt;lexical tone&lt;/em&gt; contrast but instead something else. How do we count? (Actually, the same question applies to much of North Germanic.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kölsch: 0. Unless I&amp;rsquo;m grossly mistaken, it does have a similar type of &amp;lsquo;tonal accent&amp;rsquo; system to Limburg. So either both have tones or neither.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Baltic

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Latvian: 2. That&amp;rsquo;s just incorrect, I think – at least in conservative varieties you have a three-way contrast in stressed syllables. OK, the third &amp;lsquo;accent&amp;rsquo; involves glottalization as well, but how do we decide to exclude that?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lithuanian: 0. Definitely has a pitch accent system. If Latvian is treated as having two contrasts then surely Lithuanian should have (at least) two?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slavic

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Serbian: 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Croatian: 0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chakavian [sic]: 3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bosnian: 0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To me, this doesn&amp;rsquo;t really compute: there are certainly differences among these varieties but as far as I know they&amp;rsquo;re not quite as drastic. (That is off the top of my head, though, I&amp;rsquo;m willing to be corrected.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also note that Basque has 0 contrasts, while Japanese has 2 or 3; there are dialects of Basque that have been argued to have a similar pitch accent system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of this is to say that the ANU database is bad and unusable, or that the paper is incorrect rubbish. This is a random, small selection of unrelated languages in a particular region. There is also much to be said for treating European tonal accents as a typologically unusual special case – Jakobson did that with Baltic tonal &lt;em&gt;Sprachbund&lt;/em&gt; in 1931 already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the authors are clear that their predictions should be particularly salient in relatively extreme environmental conditions, so it&amp;rsquo;s not entirely beside the point to look at northern Europe more closely. And it&amp;rsquo;s interesting that in the survey above the ANU database is consistently underreporting the number of tonal contrasts in this fairly cold, fairly dry region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This does worry me. I&amp;rsquo;m sure the statistical models give the correct results for the data that&amp;rsquo;s fed into them. I&amp;rsquo;m willing to accept that the large amount of data might drown out this sort of noise. And yet, still, I&amp;rsquo;m finding it difficult to be convinced in matters I know little about when the things that I do know something about are a bit dodgy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, this isn&amp;rsquo;t about bashing the munging of large-scale data. This paper is certainly quite explicit in its hypotheses and proposes a causal explanation based on more than correlations alone. But the data appears to have been collected without much regard to the theoretical underpinnings of what it is that we&amp;rsquo;re actually collecting here. And that means I&amp;rsquo;m not sure.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Emacs: give a DOI, get a BibTeX entry</title>
<link>http://anghyflawn.github.io/blog/2014/emacs-give-a-doi-get-a-bibtex-entry/</link>
<pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
<guid>http://anghyflawn.github.io/blog/2014/emacs-give-a-doi-get-a-bibtex-entry/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;One of my enduring frustrations with the various academic publishing platforms (CJO, ScienceDirect, JSTOR and their ilk) is the wildly inconsistent way in which they export BibTeX entries for articles. Sometimes they put them right on the browser page for easy copy-and-paste; sometimes it comes up after a few clicks in a new window; sometimes you end up downloading a file with an impossibly long or counterintuitive name, or called something like &lt;code&gt;science.bib&lt;/code&gt; (which Chrome tends to turn into &lt;code&gt;science (14).bib&lt;/code&gt; as they accumulate). Since I really only need the BibTeX entry once to get into my master &lt;code&gt;.bib&lt;/code&gt; file, that is a waste of time and resources. So if you&amp;rsquo;re using Emacs, here&amp;rsquo;s a simple function which might be helpful&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-elisp&#34;&gt;(defun get-bibtex-from-doi (doi)
 &amp;quot;Get a BibTeX entry from the DOI&amp;quot;
 (interactive &amp;quot;MDOI: &amp;quot;)
 (let ((url-mime-accept-string &amp;quot;text/bibliography;style=bibtex&amp;quot;))
   (with-current-buffer 
     (url-retrieve-synchronously 
       (format &amp;quot;http://dx.doi.org/%s&amp;quot; 
       	(replace-regexp-in-string &amp;quot;http://dx.doi.org/&amp;quot; &amp;quot;&amp;quot; doi)))
     (switch-to-buffer (current-buffer))
     (goto-char (point-max))
     (setq bibtex-entry 
     	  (buffer-substring 
          	(string-match &amp;quot;@&amp;quot; (buffer-string))
              (point)))
     (kill-buffer (current-buffer))))
 (insert (decode-coding-string bibtex-entry &#39;utf-8))
 (bibtex-fill-entry))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will ask you for the DOI (you can keep the &lt;code&gt;http://dx.doi.org/&lt;/code&gt; bit that you get if you do &amp;lsquo;Copy Link Address&amp;rsquo; from the browser), pull the BibTeX entry via the DOI API, and insert it at point. (I&amp;rsquo;m assuming the buffer is in &lt;code&gt;bibtex-mode&lt;/code&gt; already, since it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really make sense for it not to be.) Put this in your &lt;code&gt;init.el&lt;/code&gt; and you can now do &lt;code&gt;M-x get-bibtex-from-doi&lt;/code&gt;, or bind it to a keychord of your choice. The entry might still need fiddling with (e.g. to fix the citekey in line with your scheme, or to remove the Unicode characters if need be), but hopefully this might be useful.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;Although my job title is &amp;lsquo;Lecturer in Theoretical Phonology&amp;rsquo; (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/pavel-iosad(976edf38-f950-4179-a032-a6cea4b31b3b.html&#34;&gt;no, really&lt;/a&gt;), I&amp;rsquo;ve been getting into more empirical work. I went on a data collection trip to South Wales in February to work with Welsh, and only early this week we had two great days collecting Gaelic data in North Argyll – not an area &lt;em&gt;readily&lt;/em&gt; associated with Gaelic these days, but in fact we found quite a few very good speakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this post isn&amp;rsquo;t about that. Having collected the data and processed some of it, I have also been getting to grips with &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; doing statistical analysis (as opposed to working through textbooks), which these days inevitably means &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.r-project.org.&#34;&gt;R&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m giving a couple of talks in Wales next week (&lt;a href=&#34;http://privatewww.essex.ac.uk/~wss/wss-21.htm&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://amrywiaeth.wordpress.com&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) with some of the results, so the time had come for me to think about getting my data into my presentations (and eventually papers). Being a LaTeX user, after some poking about I settled on &lt;a href=&#34;http://yihui.name/knitr&#34;&gt;knitr&lt;/a&gt; as the way to get stuff out of R and into LaTeX.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the R wizards I know use &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rstudio.com&#34;&gt;RStudio&lt;/a&gt;, which is a very good IDE for R, but doesn&amp;rsquo;t come close to the power of Emacs with AUCTeX for LaTeX writing. So far I have found &lt;a href=&#34;http://ess.r-studio.org&#34;&gt;ESS&lt;/a&gt; to be perfectly adequare for my R needs. ESS also supports knitting &lt;code&gt;.Rnw&lt;/code&gt; files out of the box via &lt;code&gt;M-n r&lt;/code&gt;. Its default weaving engine, however, is Sweave. After some poking about, here&amp;rsquo;s how to get ESS and AUCTeX to play nicely with knitr.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two components. One is to make knitr the default engine when tangling outside AUCTeX. This is easily achieved via &lt;code&gt;(setq ess-swv-processor &#39;knitr)&lt;/code&gt; in your &lt;code&gt;init.el&lt;/code&gt;, but this only allows you to use knitr as the default when you tangle via &lt;code&gt;M-n T&lt;/code&gt;. What this doesn&amp;rsquo;t automate is running LaTeX on the product of the knitting: you have to switch to the &lt;code&gt;.tex&lt;/code&gt; file manually and run stuff from there, but this runs the risk of making edits to the &lt;code&gt;.tex&lt;/code&gt; file instead of the &lt;code&gt;.Rnw&lt;/code&gt;. ESS also has a &lt;code&gt;latex&lt;/code&gt; tangling option (&lt;code&gt;M-n l&lt;/code&gt;), but this just runs &lt;code&gt;latex&lt;/code&gt; from the shell, without any of the AUCTeX customizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ESS also has the option to plug into AUCTeX, making relevant commands available to the user via &lt;code&gt;C-c C-c&lt;/code&gt;. This is much handier, but unfortunately the functions which add these commands are hardcoded to use Sweave from the shell rather than &lt;code&gt;ess-swv-run-in-R&lt;/code&gt;, which is sensitive to the value of &lt;code&gt;ess-swv-processor&lt;/code&gt;. So here&amp;rsquo;s what you need in order to get knitr to run into AUCTeX.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-elisp&#34;&gt;;; somewhere after (require &#39;ess-site)
(setq ess-swv-plug-into-AUCTeX-p t)

(defun ess-swv-add-TeX-commands ()
  &amp;quot;Add commands to AUCTeX&#39;s \\[TeX-command-list].&amp;quot;
  (unless (and (featurep &#39;tex-site) (featurep &#39;tex))
    (error &amp;quot;AUCTeX does not seem to be loaded&amp;quot;))
  (add-to-list &#39;TeX-command-list
               &#39;(&amp;quot;Knit&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Rscript -e \&amp;quot;library(knitr); knit(&#39;%t&#39;)\&amp;quot;&amp;quot;
                 TeX-run-command nil (latex-mode) :help
                 &amp;quot;Run Knitr&amp;quot;) t)
  (add-to-list &#39;TeX-command-list
               &#39;(&amp;quot;LaTeXKnit&amp;quot; &amp;quot;%l %(mode) %s&amp;quot;
                 TeX-run-TeX nil (latex-mode) :help
                 &amp;quot;Run LaTeX after Knit&amp;quot;) t)
  (setq TeX-command-default &amp;quot;Knit&amp;quot;)
  (mapc (lambda (suffix)
          (add-to-list &#39;TeX-file-extensions suffix))
        &#39;(&amp;quot;nw&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Snw&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Rnw&amp;quot;)))

(defun ess-swv-remove-TeX-commands (x)
  &amp;quot;Helper function: check if car of X is one of the Knitr strings&amp;quot;
  (let ((swv-cmds &#39;(&amp;quot;Knit&amp;quot; &amp;quot;LaTeXKnit&amp;quot;)))
    (unless (member (car x) swv-cmds) x)))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are just little changes to the original functions defined in &lt;code&gt;ess-swv.el&lt;/code&gt;. Now you can, via &lt;code&gt;C-c C-c&lt;/code&gt;, access &lt;code&gt;Knit&lt;/code&gt; (which just produces the &lt;code&gt;.tex&lt;/code&gt; file) and &lt;code&gt;LaTeXKnit&lt;/code&gt;, which runs the LaTeX process as customized by AUCTeX (e.g. to use XeTeX or whatever other options you normally use) on the output, without you having to go the &lt;code&gt;.tex&lt;/code&gt; file. Which is nice.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The phonology and morphosyntax of Breton mutation</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;I analyse of initial consonant mutation in a Breton dialect, with a
focus on establishing the division of labour between phonology and
morphology in the triggering of mutation and its phonological
expression. I argue that different types of mutation have different
status in the grammar: some are purely phonological, others involve
subsegmental morphemes with a clear morphosyntactic rationale, and for
some the phonological aspects are clear but the morphosyntactic
motivation remains obscure. In addition, the differences among the
types of mutation support a stratal model of morphology-phonology
interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Приглашенный мини-курс «Фонологическая теория», Москва, ГУ-ВШЭ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;В настоящем курсе рассматриваются важнейшие вопросы фонологической теории в ее генеративном варианте. Курс состоит из пяти лекций:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;лекция-1-архитектура-фонологической-теории:c045439eba0f66e41cba4f58ececd1bb&#34;&gt;Лекция 1: Архитектура фонологической теории&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://anghyflawn.github.io/phon-theory-hse/hse-handout-01.pdf&#34; class=&#34;badge badge-small&#34;&gt;&lt;i class=&#34;fa fa-file-pdf-o&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;материалы&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Тема первой лекции — устройство фонологической теории, место фонологии в теории грамматики и мотивация динамического (генеративного) подхода. В рамках современной теории фонологический модуль представляется как механизм, соотносящий фонологические объекты (множества сегментов, признаков, граничных символов и т.п.), предоставленные словарем, с другими фонологическими объектами, которые описываются в терминах того же алфавита, что и «входные данные», и интерпретируются фонетическим компонентом. В этой лекции рассматриваются мотивация такого подхода, которая связана в первую очередь с его успехом в описании (мор)фонологических чередований, и его преимущества перед одноуровневым описанием, характерным для традиционных фонематических теорий.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;лекция-2-морфонологические-чередования-и-порядок-правил:c045439eba0f66e41cba4f58ececd1bb&#34;&gt;Лекция 2: Морфонологические чередования и порядок правил&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://anghyflawn.github.io/phon-theory-hse/hse-handout-02.pdf&#34; class=&#34;badge badge-small&#34;&gt;&lt;i class=&#34;fa fa-file-pdf-o&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;материалы&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Во второй лекции мы рассмотрим некоторые типы чередований, которые могут быть изящно описаны в рамках многоуровневой теории. Особое внимание будет уделено «неавтоматическим» чередованиям, условия для которых плохо описываются без привлечения данных о промежуточных представлениях (т.е. о формах соответствующих слов, неидентичных их поверхностным представлениям). Будет рассмотрена типология порядка правил (питающий, блокирующий, контрпитающий и контрблокирующий порядки) и проблема непрозрачности.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Многоуровневый подход в фонологии предполагает возможность существования достаточно абстрактных представлений на глубинных уровнях, которые сводятся к более «реалистичным» с помощью сложных систем фонологических правил. Тема третьей лекции — различные подходы к разрешению противоречия между (достаточно мощными) формальными возможностями теории и типологически наблюдаемым преобладанием систем, традиционно называемых «естественными» или «немаркированными». Мы рассмотрим несколько возможных ограничений на глубину дериваций, типы правил и порядок их применения (естественная фонология, условие обязательности чередования, строгая цикличность); особое внимание будет уделено лексической фонологии — наиболее разработанной морфонологической концепции.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Тема четвертой лекции — различные подходы к уточнению признаковой теории, в первую очередь вопрос о привативности фонологических признаков, признаковой геометрии и неполной спецификации. Как известно, еще Трубецкой в «Основах фонологии» предлагал различать эквиполентные (и градуальные) оппозиции, предполагающие возможность двух (или более) значений признака, и привативные, для которых существенно лишь наличие либо отсутствие признака. Мы рассмотрим типологические данные, говорящие в пользу привативности по крайней мере некоторых признаков, и обсудим вопрос о том, может ли фонологическая теория вовсе обойтись без бинарных признаков. Существование привативных признаков также предполагает возможность отсутствия фонологической спецификации по некоторым параметрам: мы рассмотрим несколько теоретических подходов к такой неполной спецификации. Наконец, теория признаковой геометрии постулирует существование древовидной структуры составляющих «внутри» сегмента: в этой лекции мы обсудим некоторые преимущества такого подхода.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;лекция-5-ограничения-в-фонологии-теория-оптимальности:c045439eba0f66e41cba4f58ececd1bb&#34;&gt;Лекция 5: Ограничения в фонологии, теория оптимальности&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Традиционную фонологическую теорию можно назвать «ориентированной на входные данные»: действие правил определяется состоянием системы до их запуска. Одно из следствий такого подхода: невозможность адекватного описания так называемых «заговоров», когда некая поверхностная структура избегается за счет применения формально не связанных друг с другом правил. В этой лекции мы обсудим вопрос о необходимости дополнить правила ограничениями, регулирующими применение правил, и недостатки такого гибридного подхода. В рамках лекции также будет дано введение в теорию оптимальности — подход, полностью отказывающийся от правил и оперирующий одними лишь ограничениями.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Phonologization of redundant contrasts and the Contrastivist Hypothesis</title>

<guid>http://anghyflawn.github.io/presentation/2014/phonologization-of-redundant-contrasts-and-the-contrastivist-hypothesis/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I consider two cases of predictable distributions of phonological categories: &amp;lsquo;tense&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;lax&amp;rsquo; long vowels in South-West Welsh and the two varieties of the FACE vowel in Ulster English. Their predictable (&amp;lsquo;non-phonemic&amp;rsquo;) distribution is a challenge to the Contrastivist Hypothesis, but I argue that it can be accommodated if we assume that learning, including category formation, proceeds bottom-up, and that learners do not unlearn predictably distributed categories unless compelled to do so by alternations. This forces even predictably distributed symbols into underlying representations, and the Contrastivist Hypothesis is not falsified. The bottom-up learning also predicts the possibility of &amp;lsquo;leaks&amp;rsquo; (i.e. imperfect transmission of the conditions of the distribution), and the prediction appears correct in both cases considered here.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Emacs: give a DOI, get a BibTeX entry</title>
<link>http://anghyflawn.github.io/blog/2014/emacs-give-a-doi-get-a-bibtex-entry/</link>
<pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
<guid>http://anghyflawn.github.io/blog/2014/emacs-give-a-doi-get-a-bibtex-entry/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;One of my enduring frustrations with the various academic publishing platforms (CJO, ScienceDirect, JSTOR and their ilk) is the wildly inconsistent way in which they export BibTeX entries for articles. Sometimes they put them right on the browser page for easy copy-and-paste; sometimes it comes up after a few clicks in a new window; sometimes you end up downloading a file with an impossibly long or counterintuitive name, or called something like &lt;code&gt;science.bib&lt;/code&gt; (which Chrome tends to turn into &lt;code&gt;science (14).bib&lt;/code&gt; as they accumulate). Since I really only need the BibTeX entry once to get into my master &lt;code&gt;.bib&lt;/code&gt; file, that is a waste of time and resources. So if you&amp;rsquo;re using Emacs, here&amp;rsquo;s a simple function which might be helpful&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-elisp&#34;&gt;(defun get-bibtex-from-doi (doi)
 &amp;quot;Get a BibTeX entry from the DOI&amp;quot;
 (interactive &amp;quot;MDOI: &amp;quot;)
 (let ((url-mime-accept-string &amp;quot;text/bibliography;style=bibtex&amp;quot;))
   (with-current-buffer 
     (url-retrieve-synchronously 
       (format &amp;quot;http://dx.doi.org/%s&amp;quot; 
       	(replace-regexp-in-string &amp;quot;http://dx.doi.org/&amp;quot; &amp;quot;&amp;quot; doi)))
     (switch-to-buffer (current-buffer))
     (goto-char (point-max))
     (setq bibtex-entry 
     	  (buffer-substring 
          	(string-match &amp;quot;@&amp;quot; (buffer-string))
              (point)))
     (kill-buffer (current-buffer))))
 (insert (decode-coding-string bibtex-entry &#39;utf-8))
 (bibtex-fill-entry))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will ask you for the DOI (you can keep the &lt;code&gt;http://dx.doi.org/&lt;/code&gt; bit that you get if you do &amp;lsquo;Copy Link Address&amp;rsquo; from the browser), pull the BibTeX entry via the DOI API, and insert it at point. (I&amp;rsquo;m assuming the buffer is in &lt;code&gt;bibtex-mode&lt;/code&gt; already, since it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really make sense for it not to be.) Put this in your &lt;code&gt;init.el&lt;/code&gt; and you can now do &lt;code&gt;M-x get-bibtex-from-doi&lt;/code&gt;, or bind it to a keychord of your choice. The entry might still need fiddling with (e.g. to fix the citekey in line with your scheme, or to remove the Unicode characters if need be), but hopefully this might be useful.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The [ATR]/laryngeal connection and emergent features</title>

<pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
<guid>http://anghyflawn.github.io/presentation/2014/the-atr-laryngeal-connection-and-emergent-features/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I offer a preliminary analysis of the phenomenon of &lt;em&gt;calediad&lt;/em&gt; (&amp;lsquo;provection&amp;rsquo;) in South-Eastern Welsh, whereby &amp;lsquo;voiced&amp;rsquo; (lenis) stops become &amp;lsquo;voiceless&amp;rsquo; after a stressed vowel. I argue that since vowels before lenis stops are generally long &amp;mdash; and, given the phonology of South Welsh &amp;mdash; tense, provection is an example of vowel-consonant interaction, where the same feature is used for the tense/lax contrast in vowels and laryngeal contrast in consonants. I interpret this as supporting emergent feature theory.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A nynorsk for Scotland?</title>

<description>

&lt;p&gt;With the Scottish independence debate we hear a lot about the Scandinavian connections and (dis)similarities. I do have my opinions on many of those despite being completely unqualified, but here&amp;rsquo;s one thing that strikes me and that I do know something about: how many people (apart from &lt;a href=&#34;http://catalogue.lib.ed.ac.uk/vwebv/holdingsInfo?searchId=3299&amp;amp;recCount=10&amp;amp;recPointer=1&amp;amp;bibId=1691570&#34;&gt;Guy Puzey&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forskning.no/blog/vangsnes/373842&#34;&gt;Øystein Vangsnes&lt;/a&gt;) have commented on the parallels between Norway and Scotland with regard to their linguistic landscape?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;norway:31d33451f05163bc8e46696038836205&#34;&gt;Norway&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The official position is that there are two written forms of the (single) Norwegian language, &lt;em&gt;bokmål&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;nynorsk&lt;/em&gt;. Historically, bokmål descends from the so-called &lt;em&gt;dannet dagligtale&lt;/em&gt;, the &amp;lsquo;educated vernacular&amp;rsquo;, essentially a Norwegianized (more so in pronunciation, perhaps less in other aspects) version of Danish spoken in the bigger urban areas of Norway. Nynorsk is a written standard created by the linguist Ivar Aasen, consciously based on traditional regional dialects (mostly of Western Norway) and thus opposed to the more Danish-influenced speech of the urban middle and upper classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Landsmål (as Ivar Aasen&amp;rsquo;s language was originally called) was very much a child of its time, when being &amp;lsquo;authentically Norwegian&amp;rsquo; conferred an important legitimacy. The framing of bokmål as &amp;lsquo;Danish&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;alien&amp;rsquo; (and nynorsk as &amp;lsquo;boorish&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;hick&amp;rsquo; – &lt;em&gt;bondsk&lt;/em&gt;, or, as the Irish put it, &lt;em&gt;culchie&lt;/em&gt;) survives, to a certain extent, even to this day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, nynorsk enjoys equal rights with bokmål in law, but it is increasingly being confined to its strongholds in rural parts of Western Norway (where it is has traditionally been the written language given its proximity to the local dialects) and to scattered pockets of people who value it as an expression of Norwegian identity (or of their local identity once they move to the bokmål-dominated city). For many others, it is a dead language, hated as a school subject, a waste of public money and a laughable relic of the past; a veritable curiosity cabinet of these attitudes is presented by Øystein Vangsnes (full disclosure: a former colleague of mine) in his recent &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.samlaget.no/nn-no/fakta%20og%20dokumentar/spraak/spraakleg-toleranse-i-noreg-norge-for-faen/hefta.aspx&#34;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is not the whole story, however. Norway is also host to several other indigenous minority languages, and nynorsk, with its hundreds of thousands of active users (and fairly robust intergenerational transmission, if we can speak of such a thing for a written norm) is in ruddy health compared to some of those. The biggest is Northern Sámi (about 20,000 speakers, not all of them in Norway), with Lule Sámi (not more than 2,000 speakers, most of them in Sweden) and South Sámi (speakers numbering in the hundreds and also split between Norway and Sweden) in addition to Kven (a few thousand speakers); all are spoken as community languages in Northern Norway, a large, sparsely populated, remote region. Although mainstream Norwegian culture is happy for the Sámi to exist and attract tourists with their colourful costume and fluffy reindeer, attempts to make the Sámi language more visible are met at best with indifference (in the south of the country, where people honestly don&amp;rsquo;t understand what the big deal is) and at worst with aggression, whether in Kåfjord / Gáivuotna (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dagbladet.no/kultur/2001/02/06/240324.html&#34;&gt;bilingual signs shot at&lt;/a&gt;), Bodø / Bådåddjo (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.an.no/nyheter/article6055007.ece&#34;&gt;signs repeatedly vandalized&lt;/a&gt;) or Tromsø / Romsa (no signs actually went up after a soberingly aggressive discussion).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;scotland:31d33451f05163bc8e46696038836205&#34;&gt;Scotland&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does any of that sound familiar in Scotland? I&amp;rsquo;d say it does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relationship between Scots, however loaded and vague that term is in today&amp;rsquo;s Scotland, and Scottish Standard English, is not at all unlike the nynorsk/bokmål divide. SSE is essentially a more Scottified version (quite a bit in pronunciation, less so in other areas) of a closely related language that gained prestige by virtue of being associated with a politically dominant southern neighbour. Any legitimacy that Scots can claim comes, on the one hand, from the relative strength of traditional dialects in rural parts such as the north-east and the Northern Isles, and on the other hand from its role as a vehicle for the expression of Scottish identity and a continuous link with a &amp;lsquo;more Scottish past&amp;rsquo;. Opponents of a Scots written culture of course deride it in turn as rural and uneducated or as a futile exercise by latte-swilling idealists who wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be caught dead anywhere near a farm in Banffshire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time the indigenous language, Gaelic, is confined to the remote and rural Highlands and Islands. Attempts to increase its profile in the Lowlands end up being attacked as supporting a dead language, a laughable relic of the past, and parents sending their children to Gaelic-medium schools derided as insufferable élitists happy to waste public money on something so inconsequential as Scotland&amp;rsquo;s ancient language. In parts of the Highlands people are altogether more &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.scotsman.com/news/scotland/top-stories/anti-gaelic-gunmen-shoot-road-sign-in-caithness-1-3075913&#34;&gt;trigger-happy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;not-the-same-of-course:31d33451f05163bc8e46696038836205&#34;&gt;Not the same, of course&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The parallels are by no means perfect. For instance, the average Scottish person in Ayr or Kirkcaldy is much happier to view the history and culture of the Highlands and Islands as authentically &amp;lsquo;Scottish&amp;rsquo; compared to the attitude of somebody from Hønefoss or Arendal to the Sámi – for one thing, the average Norwegian doesn&amp;rsquo;t really know much about the Sámi beyond the fact that they herd reindeer (actually, most of them don&amp;rsquo;t), wear funny hats and drink a lot. All right, one could question how much the average Lowlander &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; knows about Gaelic culture, but still, the days of the Highlanders as racially alien brutes are mostly past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A big consequence of this is that the relevance of Gaelic to contemporary Scotland is a subject of debate. That debate can be acrimonious and at times stupid, but it exists. Mainstream Norwegian society does not so much oppress the Sámi and Kvens as it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really care about them. The debate only exists in Northern Norway, and is wound up with all sorts of vexed questions about Northern identity in the broader Norwegian context that might again be quite reminiscent of the debates in Scotland or Catalonia – but for the average Norwegian the Sámi languages and Kven might as well be spoken on another planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing is that the Norwegian romantic nationalism that legitimized Ivar Aasen&amp;rsquo;s landsmål had no real counterpart in Scotland. Despite the importance of Ossianism, nineteenth-century Scotland was happy to see itself as a successful part of the British Empire, and did not need to legitimize itself through links to a glorious past (which is more than a bit ironic, given that Scots &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; the potential for building on the written tradition of Older Scots, whereas landsmål/nynorsk was self-consciously a modern creation rather than the continuation of a mediæval tradition – and look which has been more successful).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-politics-of-a-new-language:31d33451f05163bc8e46696038836205&#34;&gt;The politics of a new language&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_language_conflict&#34;&gt;Norwegian language struggle&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;språkstriden&lt;/em&gt;) teaches us is that the legitimacy of a language, whether spoken or written, has absolutely nothing to do with any objective linguistic distance. Bored high-schoolers in Oslo claim to not understand a word of nynorsk not because they don&amp;rsquo;t (this is a pretty laughable notion, to be honest) but because moaning about it is much more acceptable than to be seen making an effort to engage with it (unless you&amp;rsquo;re a swot). Northern Norwegians will tell you that it is so Western and far from their own dialect that they&amp;rsquo;d rather stick to bokmål, even though nynorsk did hold a &lt;a href=&#34;https://nn.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skulem%C3%A5l_i_Nord-Noreg&#34;&gt;strong position in significant parts of Northern Norway&lt;/a&gt; at some point – not to mention the fact that many northern Norwegian dialects are probably much more similar to nynorsk than to bokmål. In Norwegian politics, the code for &amp;lsquo;we hate nynorsk&amp;rsquo; is &amp;lsquo;families should have the freedom of choice&amp;rsquo;, buttressed by arguments such as &amp;lsquo;the immigrants get confused and don&amp;rsquo;t understand nynorsk&amp;rsquo; (this one always got me: these slogans are usually fronted by speakers of urban Eastern Norwegian varieties, and being used to Northern Norwegian I often struggled to understand &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt; because of the great difference in pitch accents – why don&amp;rsquo;t we abolish bokmål because, you know, there are quite a few immigrants who don&amp;rsquo;t understand &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;, either) – ironically, it is reported there are only two pupils in all of Oslo who insist on being taught in nynorsk, and, guess what, &lt;a href=&#34;http://framtida.no/articles/einaste-nynorskelevane-i-oslo-fordel-a-skriva-nynorsk&#34;&gt;they&amp;rsquo;re both from immigrant families&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further corollary is that the outcome does not necessarily come from the numerical strength of people willing to identify with a particular form of a language: perceived legitimacy and a political will are much more important. Here, it is instructive to compare Scotland with Northern Ireland: despite the Scottish government&amp;rsquo;s goodwill noises, actual political action to support Ulster-Scots has been much more extensive, despite the fact that Ulster-Scots has little if any independent tradition to fall back on and a very small base of people willing to support it. The obvious reason, of course, is that Ulster-Scots is caught up in the Northern Irish political football game as a counterpoint to the support for Irish promised by the Belfast Agreement (and &lt;a href=&#34;http://sluggerotoole.com/2014/01/09/cuts-and-splits-how-the-irish-language-communitys-most-effective-advocates-are-being-silenced/&#34;&gt;that&amp;rsquo;s not going extremely well, either&lt;/a&gt;), but that&amp;rsquo;s a story for another day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;so-where-does-this-leave-scotland:31d33451f05163bc8e46696038836205&#34;&gt;So, where does this leave Scotland?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the face of it, the similarities between Scots and nynorsk are undeniable, if not entirely compelling. Does it mean it could gain the same sort of recognition? In theory, yes, especially in an independent Scotland (or maybe a Scotland with more devolution, or even a Scotland  gaining independence at the second attempt).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reality, however, I would imagine that Gaelic is a better candidate for &amp;lsquo;Scotland&amp;rsquo;s nynorsk&amp;rsquo;. It already has widespread legitimacy as an authentic part of Scottish heritage, and, despite the loud opposition, support for measures such as Gaelic-medium education has been quietly growing. The idea that one day the culchie dialect made up by that Aasen crackpot will be taught in every school must have seemed ludicrous to a mid-19th century Oslo clerk, and yet that&amp;rsquo;s exactly what  happened. Despite the pressure nynorsk finds itself under, and despite the salutary lessons from Ireland, it does not seem impossible that, in the right circumstances, Gaelic may yet gain a foothold in mainstream Scottish society. It will always remains a niche pursuit, but the Norwegian example shows that concerted action may yet provide a strong foundation for its maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what of Scots? Again, in theory the same type of action might build a base for it too. In practice, it faces an uphill battle: the framing of &lt;em&gt;riksmål&lt;/em&gt; as &amp;lsquo;too Danish&amp;rsquo; could be a successful strategy in the romantic-nationalist Norway of the 19th century, but attacks on Standard Scottish English as &amp;lsquo;too English&amp;rsquo; are unlikely to sway many people in 21st-century Scotland. In a reversal of our Norwegian parallels, I would suggest that its best hope is building a strong regional base: just as Sámi is much more important  in Northern Norway without having much of an impact down south, so written Scots – perhaps in a more regionalized Scotland – could gain legitimacy in a more local context. But I don&amp;rsquo;t know quite enough about that part of the world to make any definite pronouncements.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;We consider the status of &amp;lsquo;voiced&amp;rsquo; (really lenis) fricatives in Old English and in Brythonic Celtic. In the received view, they are not &amp;lsquo;phonemic&amp;rsquo; in Old English, yet their distribution is clearly sensitive to phonological structure. We propose that they &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; distinct phonological symbols, coerced into predictable distributions by the phonological computation. We also offer a similar analysis for Brythonic Celtic. The situation is argued to result as a predictable consequence of the life cycle of phonological processes rather than from language contact, &lt;em&gt;contra&lt;/em&gt; previous suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;I analyse two cases where segment epenthesis must be phonological but involves segments that are otherwise non-phonemic in the relevant languages: Argyll Gaelic (see also the &lt;a href=&#34;http://anghyflawn.github.io/presentation/2013/glottal-stop-insertion-in-scottish-gaelic-and-contrastive-syllabification/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Teangeolaoícht na Gaeilge&lt;/em&gt; talk&lt;/a&gt; to this effect) and Zealand Danish. Such involvement of non-contrastive information in phonological rules might be problematic for contrastivist approaches to phonology. I argue that this problem can be resolve if the epenthesis is analysed as not involving &lt;em&gt;segments&lt;/em&gt;, but instead &lt;em&gt;features&lt;/em&gt; attaching directly to suprasegmental nodes.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The phonological endgame</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;I present an analysis of Welsh &amp;lsquo;svarabhakti&amp;rsquo;, whereby a copy of a preceding vowel is inserted to break up final clusters of rising sonority (&lt;em&gt;pwdr&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lsquo;rotten&amp;rsquo; is [pudur] rather than *[pudr]). This pattern is said to coexist with a pattern of deleting consonants in such clusters in polysyllables (&lt;em&gt;perygl&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lsquo;danger&amp;rsquo; is [perɪɡ] rather than *[perɪɡl]). It has been argued that the two differing outcomes can be reconciled by appeal to a single constraint on the form of feet. I show that this analysis is not tenable for South Welsh, and propose that deletion (as in &lt;em&gt;perygl&lt;/em&gt;) is not part of the phonological grammar (at least in South Welsh).&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Vowel reduction in Russian</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;In this paper I propose a substance-free analysis of vowel reduction in Standard Russian. I argue that the traditional distinction between &amp;lsquo;moderate&amp;rsquo; reduction (in pretonic syllables, producing less central vowels) and &amp;lsquo;radical&amp;rsquo; reduction (producing central vowels) is not phonologically relevant. The phonological grammar is only responsible for the neutralization patterns and not for the exact phonetic properties of their outcome. In addition, I show that the necessary input-output mappings cannot be effected in a conventional featural system without some weakly supported assumptions: I argue that this demonstrates the viability of a substance-free, emergent-features approach to phonology.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>In defence of Richness of the Base</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;I briefly present the analysis of mora assignment to consonants in South Welsh. The pattern can be analysed by appeal to the form of the inputs (i.e. with a massive number of accidental gaps, which is undesirable), or by positing a constraint schema with undesirable consequences for factorial typology. I suggest that the latter solution is preferable theoretically, although it may be premature to choose it for that reason alone.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A unified account of the behaviour of high vowels in Bothoa Breton</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;I offer an analysis of gliding in Bothoa Breton, as presented in the thesis. I argue that high vowels (especially [i]) either become glides or coalesce with a preceding consonant, in order to avoid hiatus. However, this pattern is disrupted if the high vowel becomes a nucleus at an earlier stage in the cyclic derivation. This provides an argument for stratal models of phonology-morphology interactions, and a strong argument &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; Output-Output Correspondence, because some of the exceptional non-gliding cases cannot be explained by reference to a free-standing form with transparent non-gliding.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Deconstructing mutation in Breton</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;I offer the analysis of Breton initial mutations found in my thesis. I argue that there is no such thing as a unified &amp;lsquo;mutation&amp;rsquo; mechanism: instead, this labels covers a variety of processes with different places in the overall grammar. The article-length version of the argument is &lt;a href=&#34;http://anghyflawn.github.io/writing/breton-mutation/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Laryngeal realism revisited</title>
<link>http://anghyflawn.github.io/presentation/2012/20mfm/</link>
<pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
<guid>http://anghyflawn.github.io/presentation/2012/20mfm/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;This talk presents the near-final version of my analysis of Breton laryngeal phonology (largely superseding my &lt;a href=&#34;http://anghyflawn.github.io/presentation/2009/sandhi-mutation-and-contrast-laryngeal-phonology-in-plougrescant-breton/&#34;&gt;Toronto presentation&lt;/a&gt; and to a certain extent my &lt;a href=&#34;http://anghyflawn.github.io/presentation/2010/incomplete-neutralization-and-unorthodox-markedness-in-breton-laryngeal-phonology/&#34;&gt;talk from the 6th CLC&lt;/a&gt;). The detailed version of the analysis is in the thesis. I argue that in Breton voiceless obstruents are the marked members of the laryngeal opposition. If this is true, &amp;lsquo;laryngeal realism&amp;rsquo; is incorrect in assuming that languages which mark fortis obstruents with a feature will always realize that feature as aspiration. I argue that the tight connection between phonological contrast and phonetic representation proposed by laryngeal realism isn&amp;rsquo;t correct in any case, so this mismatch is not a major problem for the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
