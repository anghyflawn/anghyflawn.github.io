<guid>http://anghyflawn.github.io/teaching/2018/historical-phonology/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In this course (co-taught with my colleagues &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/homes/patrick&#34;&gt;Patrick Honeybone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/michael-ramsammy&#34;&gt;Michael Ramsammy&lt;/a&gt;) we consider a variety of issues connected to phonological change. Throughout the course, we address questions such as the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do we reconstruct the phonology of past language states?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What types of phonological changes are attested?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can synchronic phonological theory assist us in the study of historical phonology?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What can we learn about the human language faculty by studying historical phonology?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;sup&gt;2017&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2018&lt;/sub&gt;, I will cover the following topics (subject to change with extreme prejudice):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mechanisms and types of phonological change&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phonological typology and phonological change&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Historical phonology and phonological representations&lt;/li&gt;

<title>Towards a history of the tenseness contrast in Brythonic vowels</title>
<link>http://anghyflawn.github.io/presentation/2017/esohph3/</link>
<pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
<guid>http://anghyflawn.github.io/presentation/2017/esohph3/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Modern Welsh is similar to many modern Germanic languages such as English, German and Dutch in showing an association between &amp;lsquo;tense&amp;rsquo; vowel quality and phonological length. Specifically, long vowels tend to be tense in quality and short vowels tend to be lax, with concomitant alternations. As in the Germanic case, there is some disagreement in the literature on whether quality or quantity (or both) is phonologically relevant in Modern Welsh. In this paper I aim to add to this debate via an overview of the diatopic variation in the relationship between vowel quantity and quality in Welsh and more broadly in the Brythonic languages. I argue that tense/lax quality is likely to be diachronically secondary with respect to quantity, being derivable from prosodic contexts\dash primarily vowel length and syllable structure. One of the notable consequences of this is that even when tense/lax quality has been phonologized (as in, for instance, south-western dialects of Welsh), it is still partly conditioned by quantity and syllable structure; conversely, the distribution of quantity is not significantly determined by vowel quality, which supports the contention that quantity is synchronically active in Welsh phonology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To support this case for a secondary development of tense/lax quality, I offer a reconstruction of its rise that starts with a tensing of word-final stressed vowels, perhaps initially only restricted to high vowels. This later undergoes rule generalization  to embrace both non-high vowels (as in most dialects with tense [e:~oː]) and to syllable-final rather than word-final position (as in South Welsh dialects, where long vowels are allowed in penultimate stressed syllables). I show that intermediate stages of this development are attested across modern Welsh dialects. The secondary nature of the development is supported by the fact that Breton largely shares the quantity system of Welsh, but not the patterning of tense/lax quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I argue that the Brythonic languages present an interesting test case for theories that attempt to connect the &amp;lsquo;transphonologization&amp;rsquo; of quantity as quality with the rise of vowel shifts: despite the long/short vowels undergoing a tense/lax split, much as in many Germanic languages, the Brythonic system neither became prone to vowel shifting (as in the case of English) nor underwent a further split where the new qualities fit into a new quantity system (as in many North Germanic varieties). I tentatively suggest that this may be due to the closer relationship between tense/lax quality and syllable structure rather than syllable quantity, which is itself related to the fact that Brythonic (and Welsh in particular) experienced less neutralization of vowel quality in unstressed syllables.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;In this brief talk I draw attention to the fact that whilst pre-sonorant voicing of &lt;em&gt;fricatives&lt;/em&gt; across a word boundary appears to be fairly widely spread (at least in Europe), pre-sonorant voicing of &lt;em&gt;all obstruents&lt;/em&gt; appears to cluster in areas where &amp;lsquo;aspirating&amp;rsquo; languages are in contact with &amp;lsquo;voice&amp;rsquo; languages: the languages involved are Breton (Celtic/Gallo-Romance), Franconian/Netherlandic (e.g. Limburg Dutch, Luxembourgish), Western Polish and Slovak (Slavic/Germanic).&lt;/p&gt;

<pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
<guid>http://anghyflawn.github.io/teaching/2017/phonological-theory/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;This course introduces students to a range of important topics in (generative) phonological theory and to phonological data analysis. On the theoretical side, we cover the following topics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basics of phonological theory: contrast, phonemes, allophones, alternations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feature theory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Derivations, underlying representations, rules&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Process interaction and rule ordering&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suprasegmental phonology: syllable structure, stress, tone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advanced feature theory: feature geometry, unary features&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explanation in phonology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the course, there is a strong emphasis on building data analysis and problem solving skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This course is also offered for MSc students (as &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/17-18/dpt/cxlasc11148.htm&#34;&gt;LASC11148&lt;/a&gt;). It is suitable for postgraduate students who have had some previous exposure to phonology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following this course, students will be able to progress to advanced study of phonological theory. In &lt;sup&gt;2017&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2018&lt;/sub&gt;, we are offering both LASC10089 Current Issues in Phonology and LASC10046 Historical Phonology.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;This invited contribution to a collection on the history of phonology explores the history of phonological studies in the USSR. I offer a short history of phonology in Russia and the USSR before the formation of the two main theoretical currents (the &amp;lsquo;Leningrad&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Moscow&amp;rsquo; schools), and emphasize both their mutual common roots and their closeness to other structuralist frameworks, in particular Prague phonology. I discuss the differences between the two schools both in their approach to the phoneme and in their analysis of morphophonological alternations. Throughout, the focus is on the ways in which a focus on Russian shaped the directions of phonological thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Bridging the gap</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;I focus on reconstructing the development of vowel quality distinctions
in Brythonic and their connection with the history of vowel quantity
between the establishment of the ‘standard’ Brythonic penultimate-stress
system and the present day. In the received picture of Modern Welsh
phonology, ‘tense’ quality of non-low vowels ([i u e o]) is strongly
associated with length and, conversely, ‘lax’ quality ([ɪ ʊ ɛ ɔ]) is
associated with shortness, at least in contrastive, i.e.stressed,
position. The history of this pattern, however, remains understudied.
Some important questions that remain to be addressed are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When and how did contrastive length in penultimate syllables
(characteristic of South Welsh, Cornish and most of Breton) become
established? Is it original (and thus preserved following the stress
shift), or does it represent a secondary lengthening of vowels that
had been shortened in unstressed position? What is the position of
North Welsh with its exclusively short vowels in stressed penults
(cf. Wmffre 2003)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, does the tense/lax quality of vowels in Welsh reflect
tense/lax quality before the stress shift, or does it represent a
secondary readjustment? What is the relationship between the pattern
in stressed penultimates and in final unstressed syllables (where at
least high vowels seem to show an original length conditioning, at
least in Welsh)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is the complementary pattern of vowel and consonant length in
penultimate syllables, which is practically universal in Brythonic,
original, as implied by e.g.the classic account by Falc’hun (1951),
or is it a secondary development following stress shift?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I discuss the problems raised for these issues by traditional sources,
notably the focus on taxonomic phonemic transcription and the frequent
sidelining of consonant duration. I outline what kinds of studies are
needed to mitigate these problems. I also draw attention to some
evidence for the existence of dialects in Mid Wales that may lack a
tenseness distinction in at least some stressed syllables, and discuss
whether such systems can be accepted as evidence for the historically
secondary status of tenseness in penultimate stressed syllables.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper develops the analysis in &lt;a href=&#34;http://anghyflawn.github.io/presentation/2012/the-phonological-endgame-welsh-svarabhakti-revisited/&#34;&gt;this presentation&lt;/a&gt;. I offer an analysis of Welsh epenthesis, whereby a copy of a preceding vowel is inserted to break up final clusters of rising sonority (&lt;em&gt;pwdr&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lsquo;rotten&amp;rsquo; is [pudur] rather than *[pudr]) and deletion in such clusters in polysyllables (&lt;em&gt;perygl&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lsquo;danger&amp;rsquo; is [perɪɡ] rather than *[perɪɡl]). It has previously been argued that both processes can be analysed in a single phonological grammar. I show that this is not tenable for South Welsh dialects, and propose an analysis in terms of part-of-speech-specific allomorphy, formalized as lexical storage of POS-characterized stems rather than roots.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Microvariation in laryngeal realism</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;In this paper I consider the range of microvariation in the expression of laryngeal contrast, focusing on (voiceless) preaspiration in North Germanic. On the basis of an acoustic study, I suggest that both the presence of preaspiration and the diversity of its realization have been under-reported in existing descriptions. This, in turn, has important consequences for our understanding of the phonology of laryngeal contrast. Specifically, I argue that the observed variation in laryngeal phenomena is incompatible with a version of &amp;lsquo;laryngeal realism&amp;rsquo; that produces inferences about phonological specifications on the basis of phonetic implementation; instead, I advocate a more abstract approach that gives primacy to phonological behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As discussed by Pétur Helgason (2002), whilst preaspiration and sonorant devoicing before stops in Insular North Germanic have long been recognized by the scholarship, their distribution and behaviour in mainland varieties have been less well understood. In the case of Norwegian, for example, traditional descriptions designate preaspiration as characteristic of Jæren and Gudbrandsdalen, with only passing references for other dialects. However, Pétur Helgason has shown preaspiration to be pervasive in other North Germanic varieties. More recently preaspiration has also been described for the Norwegian of Trøndelag. Moreover, it appears possible that this picture may be partially due to under-reporting in traditional auditory descriptions: thus, Tengesdal (2015), in an instrumental study, shows that Oftedal&amp;rsquo;s (1947) claim that preaspiration of fortis stops is absent in Dalane Norwegian is likely incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I report a comparative acoustic study of preaspiration in two regions of Norway: the south-west, parts of which (Jæren, parts of Dalane) are traditionally considered preaspirating areas, and the north, where preaspiration has not been consistently described before. I show that preaspiration is  attested in (at least some) northern dialects, at rates not dissimilar to those in the west. More importantly, the data show a more granular diversity than is implied by broad dialectal labels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This microvariation in the expression of laryngeal contrast is important for our understanding of the relationship between phonological specification and phonetic substance. In particular, I suggest that the precise phonetic interpretation of a distinction between (say) fortis and lenis stops can be much more diverse than can be provided for by a theory deriving these differences from phonological specification, such as some versions of laryngeal realism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further argument in favour of the primacy of phonological behaviour is provided by [ʁ]-devoicing in south-western dialects. I argue that is both phonetically categorical (in contrast to lateral and nasal devoicing) and phonological, being triggered only by |fortis| stops. Crucially, lenis stops do not trigger any sonorant devoicing, even gradiently, despite being categorically voiceless (rather than &amp;lsquo;passively voiced&amp;rsquo;) themselves. This coarse-grained phonological behaviour is consistent with a substance-free privative analysis where obstruents are specified as |fortis| vs. ∅, but not with one that attempts to capture the phonetic behaviour of lenis stops in phonological representations.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The government has a plan for Gaelic, and you won&#39;t believe what it is</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;An important dimension that&amp;rsquo;s often missing from the debates about whether it&amp;rsquo;s worthwhile to support Gaelic or promote Scots in Scotland is &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; one would do such a thing in the first place. In today&amp;rsquo;s feverish political environment these things slide all too often into outright constitutional mudslinging or at least a debate that foregrounds the essential Scottishness of the country&amp;rsquo;s languages, either as a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thenational.scot/comment/14871672.Wee_Ginger_Dug__A_Gaelic_map_isn___t____Gaelic_imperialism_____it___s_a_restorative_act_for_the_language_which_created_Scotland&#34;&gt;good thing&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.scotsman.com/news/opinion/comment-gaelic-signs-a-spurious-vanity-project-for-snp-1-4442999&#34;&gt;bad thing&lt;/a&gt;. Scott Hames has &lt;a href=&#34;http://bellacaledonia.org.uk/2016/02/19/not-nationality-but-language&#34;&gt;written&lt;/a&gt; about this approach being unhelpful, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://anghyflawn.github.io/blog/2016/gaelic-belongs-to-all/&#34;&gt;I agree&lt;/a&gt;. But if this is not about nationality, &lt;em&gt;why indeed&lt;/em&gt; would one put up Gaelic signs in the Borders or push for more recognition of Scots?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several misconceptions are widespread among both opponents and supporters of minority language promotion. For instance, the introduction of Gaelic or Scots into schools is often framed as an attempt by the government to &amp;lsquo;teach [alternatively, indoctrinate] the children to speak&amp;rsquo; the minority language &amp;mdash; ominously, at the expense of Standard English? The infamous Gaelic signs (the number of which in all of the Lowlands probably runs, let&amp;rsquo;s face it, into the low three figures) are seen as an attempt to stake a claim on territory for Gaelic, presumably on the basis of it having been spoken in the area historically; this often tends to provoke a backlash along the lines of &amp;lsquo;why don&amp;rsquo;t we promote Welsh then &amp;mdash; isn&amp;rsquo;t it the closest living relative of the historical language of Lowland Scotland?&amp;rsquo; &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@theiaincameron/gaelic-road-signs-f14235b2984b&#34;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is a typical example.  This latter argument, of course, is only true if the purpose of Gaelic signs is to promote Gaelic for these historical reasons &amp;mdash; which supporters of the language are often wont to support, pointing to the very real Gaelic heritage of much of the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These ideas, whether espoused by well-wishers or detractors of minority languages, suffer from a failure to invert the majority&amp;rsquo;s perspective. Those who do not identify as members of the linguistic minority tend to see language policy as largely aimed at &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt;, rather than catering for the needs and desires of the minority speakers themselves. Hence the frequent trope of the language being &amp;lsquo;pushed down our throats&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;subsidies&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;catering to the needs of the minority at the expense of the majority&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the problem: the kind of visible gestures that raise the most public ire are, in fact, just that: gestures. It is preposterous to think that having a &amp;lsquo;Burns week&amp;rsquo; at school or a bunch of English lessons attempting to write a poem in Scots (it&amp;rsquo;s always a poem, of course) is sufficient to guide pupils&amp;rsquo; linguistic behaviour outside class. The way people end up speaking depends on the speech first of their caregivers, then of their peers, perhaps particularly in adolescence, and also on their attitude to the different in- and out-groups they are members of.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; A lesson or two in written Scots will no more turn a child with a middle-class accent into a speaker of broad Scots than many years of schooling eradicate non-standard varieties in working-class communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, a couple of signs at a railway station or the introduction of Gaelic into local council branding will not indoctrinate children into speaking Gaelic, and I strongly suspect they will not be able to somehow push children into having a stronger Scottish identity than they otherwise would have. Such token gestures are utterly ineffectual at the aims that they are commonly seen to have. If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for an actually effective policy tool, look at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bbc.co.uk/naidheachdan/39791058&#34;&gt;LEACAG project&lt;/a&gt; currently conducted by several Scottish universities working towards a reference grammar of Gaelic, with funding from Bòrd na Gàidhlig. Yet it doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be the target of quite so much ire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do it then? It starts making sense if you look at it from the perspective of someone who &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; (or aspires to be) a speaker of a minority language or a non-standard variety. This is part of &lt;em&gt;prestige planning&lt;/em&gt; &amp;mdash; measures that improve the perceived status of the minority language in the broader society and building democratic consent for further policy initiatives in that area. In this respect, involving the language in &amp;lsquo;official&amp;rsquo; uses such as signage or school teaching is a signal both to the minority language users themselves and to the society at large that minority and non-standard varieties are valued and respected, and not an irrelevance or an inconvenience to be dismissed. That is an important part of promoting the languages: speakers&amp;rsquo; attitudes to their language are partly, of course, personal, but also shaped to a large extent by the broader societal attitudes &amp;mdash; can we really always expect a person growing up in an environment for few signs of appreciation for the way they speak to have a positive attitude to it themselves?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is also the problem with the often-made argument that Scotland-wide promotion of Gaelic is a waste of resources and funding should be concentrated in areas where it has a stronger claim to being a &amp;lsquo;regional&amp;rsquo; language (in practice, the Highlands &amp;mdash; not even perhaps all of it &amp;mdash; and Islands). But look at it from the perspective of a speaker or user of Gaelic. The intent of the current policy is to signal to them: &amp;lsquo;we value your language because of who you are &amp;mdash; one of us &amp;mdash; not because of where you live&amp;rsquo;. A &amp;lsquo;regional&amp;rsquo; policy says: &amp;lsquo;we&amp;rsquo;ll allow you weirdos to have your fun where there&amp;rsquo;s enough of you around, but please don&amp;rsquo;t come here inconveniencing us, the numerical majority who actually matter&amp;rsquo;. This is, in some ways, quite an insidious argument that makes a &amp;lsquo;democratic&amp;rsquo; appeal to the will of the majority against the interests of the minority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have a look at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b08q3ln9&#34;&gt;this programme&lt;/a&gt; recently broadcast on BBC Alba. It&amp;rsquo;s on Gaelic in Aberdeen, showing how people with backgrounds from both the north-east and elsewhere keep the flag flying. All too often they hear people say &amp;lsquo;but it was never spoken here&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;it is being imposed&amp;rsquo;. And yet they have lived in the north-east for years, sometimes, as some of those interviewed, all their lives &amp;mdash; they are living proof that it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; spoken. How do you tell such a person that their language is an imposition and an inconvenience? This sort of argument betrays a fundamental lack of empathy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is true even when the argument is couched in the language of &amp;lsquo;I have nothing against it, but it should stand on its own two feet&amp;rsquo;. It is majority communities that have the luxury of being confident their culture and language aren&amp;rsquo;t going away, because they already have the support structure and the social scaffolding that ensures their culture and language remain in it. Building and maintaining these structures requires the kind of time and effort that very few people have to spare. Telling them to get on with it and stop being so damn visible shows the very same lack of empathy for these circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Parenthetically, the programme, quite well done and produced, is largely preaching to the choir when it&amp;rsquo;s on BBC Alba. An establishment really keen on promoting and imposing Gaelic would be showing it, probably in English, on prime-time BBC One. As noted, if the SNP or whoever are intent on pushing the language down everybody&amp;rsquo;s throats, they are doing a pretty rubbish job of it.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is, of course, a cultural, heritage argument to be made for the promotion of Gaelic &amp;mdash; one that can be legitimately appealed to if we want to decide on, say, the appropriate level of support for &amp;lsquo;immigrant&amp;rsquo; minority languages that have a &amp;lsquo;home base&amp;rsquo; outside of Scotland. But it is by no means a central plank of Gaelic-language policy. Minority language policy should focus on protecting the rights of speakers, and the rights of speakers are best served with a coherent programme of language planning. This includes prestige planning that aims to build consent for the protection of speakers&amp;rsquo; rights everywhere &amp;mdash; not just in designated areas where they are tolerated, but wherever they choose to live. People who think others shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have these rights are of course entitled to their opinion, but it would be great if they argued their case on that basis, not referring to an imagined nationalist plot or bungled heritage programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS- If you want to put yourself into the shoes of a minority language speaker Who Has Had Enough, I highly recommend &lt;a href=&#34;https://storify.com/nwdls/on-being-a-rude-welsh-speaker&#34;&gt;this tweetstorm by @Madeley&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;Incidentally, some of the groundbreaking research in this area was conducted in the significantly Scots-speaking community of Buckie in the north-east of Scotland.

<title>The phonologization of redundancy</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;‘Phonologization’ is a process whereby a phonetic phenomenon enters the phonological grammar and becomes conceptualized as the result of categorical manipulation of phonological symbols. I analyse the phonologization of a predictable phonological pattern in Welsh, with particular attention to identifying criteria for whether phonologization has occurred. I argue for a model where phonologization experiences bottom-up and top-down biases. From the bottom up, there is pressure to phonologize phenomena with a categorical distribution; from the top down, there exist formal constraints on featural specification. I focus on the requirement for featural specifications to obey the Contrastivist Hypothesis, which denies that redundant features can be involved in phonological computation, in the context of a framework with emergent features. I suggest that the Contrastivist Hypothesis acts as a useful check for emergent-feature theories, whilst independent phonologization criteria provide contrastivist approaches with a more solid conceptual underpinning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also download the R notebook with the graphics and scripts from the paper and the data itself &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org//10.17605/OSF.IO/HD3BZ&#34;&gt;here at Open Science Framework&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Variation in North Germanic preaspiration</title>
<link>http://anghyflawn.github.io/presentation/2017/variation-north-germanic-preaspiration/</link>
<pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
<guid>http://anghyflawn.github.io/presentation/2017/variation-north-germanic-preaspiration/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I consider the extent of cross-dialectal variation in the expression of laryngeal contrast within North Germanic, with a focus on (voiceless) preaspiration, and suggest that the presence of preaspiration and the diversity of its realization across the North Germanic area have been significantly under-reported in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As discussed by Pétur Helgason (2002), whilst preaspiration and sonorant devoicing in Insular Nordic have long been recognized by the scholarship, their distribution and behaviour in mainland varieties have been less well understood. Traditional descriptions designate preaspiration as characteristic of varieties in Jæren  and Gudbrandsdalen, with only passing references for other dialects such as that of Senja. In Sweden, preaspiration had been noted in Härjedalen and parts of Dalarna, as well as in dialects of the Baltic Sea islands (Gräsö, Åland and Åboland). However, as Pétur Helgason (2002) has shown, preaspiration is pervasive in other varieties, notably Central Standard Swedish. More recently preaspiration has also been studied in detail in Trøndelag Norwegian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst Pétur Helgason (2002) makes an important distinction between ‘normative’ and ‘non-normative’ preaspiration, and highlights some differences in the patterning of preaspiration between dialects, the degree of internal variation in the behaviour of preaspiration so far appears relatively small. This is in striking contrast to the significant variability observed in Scottish Gaelic preaspiration despite the comparable, if not smaller, time depth. For now, it is not clear whether this lack of variation may simply be due to under-reporting in traditional auditory descriptions. Tengesdal (2015), in an instrumental study, has shown Oftedal’s (1947) claim that preaspiration of fortis stops is absent in south-east Jæren (Bjerkreim/Dalane) to likely have been incorrect. Preaspiration in ‘non-preaspirating’ areas is also evidenced in the Nordic Dialect Corpus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I present a comparative acoustic study of preaspiration in two regions of Norway: Jæren, traditionally considered a preaspirating area, and Northern Norway, where preaspiration has not been consistently described before. I show that preaspiration is in fact prevalent in (some) northern dialects, at rates not dissimilar to those in the west. However, there are also important differences in patterning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Documenting the diversity of ways in which laryngeal contrast is realized even in closely related varieties is important for our understanding of the relationship between phonological specification and phonetic substance. I argue that the study of microvariation in laryngeal contrast supports a substance-free view of that relationship, in that even relatively abstract substance-bound approaches such as laryngeal realism  underpredict the fine-grained behaviour of features such as preaspiration. At the same time laryngeal realism and substance-free approaches both readily account for asymmetries in phonological behaviour between fortis and lenis stops. For instance, they predict that Western Norwegian voiceless lenes should be inert in assimilation despite being categorically voiceless phonetically, which I show to be correct in the case of [ʁ]-devoicing.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A substance-free framework for phonology</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;The book is a revised and updated version of parts of &lt;a href=&#34;http://anghyflawn.github.io/thesis&#34;&gt;my PhD thesis&lt;/a&gt;. From the publisher&amp;rsquo;s blurb:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the relationship between phonetics and phonology? Are
phonological features innate and universal, and do they have fixed
phonetic correlates? These questions have recently received renewed
prominence in theoretical debates, and this book explores them from
a modular, substance-free perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This in-depth analysis of Breton serves not only to introduce
previously underused data into the theoretical landscape but also to
demonstrate the viability of a modular framework for phonology. The
book introduces a minimalist system of phonological representations
built up on a language-specific basis, without regard to the
phonetic realisation of phonological objects, and integrates it with
a fully-fledged computational framework and a stratal interface
between phonology and morphosyntax, showcasing the numerous
empirical and conceptual advantages of a substance free view of
phonology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;This course is an obligatory part of the pre-Honours sequence for students on the MA (Hons) degree in Gaelic and Primary Education. It will introduce students to the linguistic analysis of the Scottish Gaelic language, giving an overview of phonetics and phonology, morphology and syntax, together with consideration of key sociolinguistic principles and issues, including phenomena relating to language contact, language shift and status and corpus planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;sup&gt;2016&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2017&lt;/sub&gt;, I will teach the sections on phonetics and phonology and on language change.&lt;/p&gt;
