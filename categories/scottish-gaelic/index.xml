<description>&lt;p&gt;This course is part of the pre-Honours sequence in all LEL single Honours degrees, as well as of some joint degrees (in addition to being available as an outside course). Its main aim is to familiarize students with the study of linguistic diversity and the relationship between language typology and theory-building. In &lt;sup&gt;2015&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2016&lt;/sub&gt;, I am acting as the course organizer for LEL2D. I am also responsible for the entire phonology block; please check back nearer the time for an outline of the exact content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Course materials will be available on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.learn.ed.ac.uk&#34;&gt;Learn&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Celtic, Norse, and English in contact</title>
<link>http://anghyflawn.github.io/teaching/2016/celtic-norse-english/</link>
<pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
<guid>http://anghyflawn.github.io/teaching/2016/celtic-norse-english/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;This course runs for the first time in &lt;sup&gt;2015&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2016&lt;/sub&gt; (but will probably run every other year). It has three main objectives:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An introduction to Celtic linguistics, via familiarizing students with the structural properties of Celtic languages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An brief introduction to the study of language contact, with particular attention to criteria used to diagnose contact features&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A discussion of various ways in which Celtic and North Germanic languages interacted with each other and with English in the British Isles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This course presupposes &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; knowledge of any modern or ancient Celtic language. However, it is also open to students pursuing Honours degrees in Celtic, as long as they have passed one of the second-year Gaelic courses &amp;mdash; while some of the linguistic concepts may require a bit of effort (especially if you haven&amp;rsquo;t taken at least LEL1 in pre-Honours), much of the language material will be familiar or sufficiently similar to Gaelic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check this page later for a course handbook. In the meantime, here is a preliminary weekly plan (subject to change with extreme prejudice):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introduction and the historical setting

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Celtic and the Anglo-Saxon conquest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Celtic and English in the Middle Ages. The Norse presence in England, Scotlad, and Ireland&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Language shift. &amp;lsquo;Celtic Englishes&amp;rsquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Celtic language structures: Old Irish. Modern Irish phonology and morphosyntax&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Celtic language structures: Scottish Gaelic. Middle Welsh. Modern Welsh phonology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Celtic language structures: Modern Welsh morphosyntax. Cornish and Breton. An introduction to language contact&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sociolinguistic complexity and types of language contact. Diagnosing historical contact. Class test (worth 30% of the mark)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Celtic hypothesis: was Early English influenced by Celtic?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contact with Norse: North Germanic and English. The Norse influence and Gaelic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Celtic Englishes: Irish English. Scotland.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Celtic Englishes: Welsh English. Cornwall and Brittany. Summary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The remaining 70% of the mark will be assessed by a final essay of 3,000 words, to be written between the end of teaching and the start of the exam period.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Preaspiration in North Argyll Gaelic and its contribution to prosodic structure</title>
<link>http://anghyflawn.github.io/presentation/2015/preaspiration-in-north-argyll-gaelic-and-its-contribution-to-prosodic-structure/</link>
<pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
<guid>http://anghyflawn.github.io/presentation/2015/preaspiration-in-north-argyll-gaelic-and-its-contribution-to-prosodic-structure/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper reports the preliminary results of an acoustic study of
preaspiration in the Gaelic of North Argyll. Existing descriptions
identify this area as reflecting Old Irish and Old Norse &amp;lsquo;voiceless&amp;rsquo;
geminates as [xp xt xk] clusters (&amp;lsquo;pre-affricates&amp;rsquo;), but, to our
knowledge, no targeted acoustic study of these varieties had been
performed to date. Our results confirm that the preaspiration found in
other varieties corresponds to dorsal (velar or uvular) frication in
North Argyll, rather than other conceivable interpretations of the
impressionistic descriptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We discuss the broader repercussions of these findings regarding the
nature of preaspiration in these varieties. In particular, we find only
very scant evidence of pre-frication after long vowels (in words like
&lt;em&gt;pàpa&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lsquo;Pope&amp;rsquo;, &lt;em&gt;bàta&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lsquo;boat&amp;rsquo;), which contrasts with regular
pre-frication after short vowels. This apparent neutralization of
laryngeal contrast outside the initial foot suggests that (at least
Argyll) Gaelic shows a weakly unconditioned reduction process (lenition;
Honeybone 2012) similar to languages such as English or
Icelandic. Further, if this analysis is correct, it suggests that
preaspiration in North Argyll Gaelic contributes a mora to the stressed
syllable (in parallel to South Argyll Gaelic, and in an echo of Ó Baoill
1980). We argue that the development from preaspiration to a moraic
segment is parallel to that hypothesized by Pétur Helgason (2002) for
Icelandic, and discuss the consequences of this analysis for the
question of internal vs external origin of preaspiration.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Irish isn’t ‘compromised’ — it just needs more support</title>
<link>http://anghyflawn.github.io/blog/2015/irish-isnt-compromised-it-just-needs-more-support/</link>
<pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
<guid>http://anghyflawn.github.io/blog/2015/irish-isnt-compromised-it-just-needs-more-support/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;There is a very interesting article now up on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sluggerotoole.com&#34;&gt;Slugger O&amp;rsquo;Toole&lt;/a&gt;, based around an interview with Dr &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.diarmuidjohnson.net&#34;&gt;Diarmuid Johnson&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=&#34;http://sluggerotoole.com/2015/07/26/do-urban-gaeltachts-produce-a-compromised-irish&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do urban Gaeltachts produce a compromised Irish?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Go read it now &amp;mdash; it&amp;rsquo;s well written and very well informed, especially if you compare it to the general level of debate around in the Irish language in Northern Ireland (as some &amp;mdash; though by no means all &amp;mdash; comments demonstrate).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full disclosure &amp;mdash; I&amp;rsquo;m an admirer of Diarmuid Johnson, and I owe him a debt of gratitude for the kind assistance I received from him in the course of my own research in  West Wales. Nevertheless, I do think that Barton Creeth is on to something in the final paragraph, saying&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be many who argue Johnson’s purism about the language is
misplaced. [&amp;hellip;] What we have in Belfast, in terms of language
revival, is probably as good as it gets, and other minority language
activists can learn a lot from the Belfast experience. The hybrid,
urban, pidginised and creolised Irish of Belfast, Dublin, Derry and
other cities across Ireland is probably the future of the language,
and it likely means a new chapter in the history of the language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s really jagging for me is the use of &amp;lsquo;compromised&amp;rsquo; to describe the non-traditional (&amp;lsquo;urban&amp;rsquo;) varieties of Irish. I suspect it starts out as an aesthetic judgement of someone very familiar with traditional Irish, but equally I suspect being perceived by many &amp;mdash; including those outside the &amp;lsquo;movement&amp;rsquo; &amp;mdash; as a value judgement. Indeed, in that same paragraph we find the burden of justification being laid squarely on the minority language users:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, parents and educators need to seriously think about
the source of Irish in Irish-medium education, and whether
Irish-medium education, in its current form, offers children the
best possible resources to fully develop intellectually and
emotionally. I’ll look forward to hearing the responses from people
who work in Irish Medium Education as well as from urban language
activists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s be honest for a moment: would we be hearing these challenges to prove that bilingualism offers the &amp;lsquo;best possible resources&amp;rsquo; for the &amp;lsquo;full development&amp;rsquo; of children if the language in question were a &amp;lsquo;major world language&amp;rsquo; rather than a minority one with a history of political string attachment?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt that traditional varieties of Irish as spoken in the Gaeltacht are under severe pressure as it finds its position weakened as a community language. An increasing proportion of those who use Irish are &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nspk.org.uk/&#34;&gt;&amp;lsquo;new speakers&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a&gt;, with relatively little access to traditional Irish as their input in language learning (as Johnson rightly points out). Indeed, some scholars, such as Dr &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dias.ie/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=576%3Adr-brian-o-curnain&amp;amp;catid=19%3Acelticstaff&amp;amp;Itemid=17&amp;amp;lang=en&#34;&gt;Brian Ó Curnáin&lt;/a&gt; at DIAS, have argued that the point of no return for traditional varieties of Irish is very close or already past, and &amp;lsquo;new-speaker&amp;rsquo; Irish is what we&amp;rsquo;re stuck with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New-speaker Irish is undoubtedly different from traditional Irish in many respects. It&amp;rsquo;s interesting, however, to look at how exactly it is different. For most people, I suspect, the most appalling sign of decline is the use of English borrowings (after all, for the average layperson, language equals vocabulary) and calques, as people complain about Gaelscoil kids saying things like &lt;em&gt;tá sin ag déanamh mo cheann isteach&lt;/em&gt;. But acquiring a language is, of course, much more than acquiring the words: it&amp;rsquo;s also about the grammatical structures and the different ways language is used in society. Some of the available research, such as that from Prof. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ulster.ac.uk/staff/am.henry.html&#34;&gt;Alison Henry&lt;/a&gt; at Ulster University (disclosure: a former colleague) has shown that to the extent learners in Irish-medium education do not attain the target state, this shows patterns associated not with some sort of terribly monstrous unnatural language but with the lack of sufficient input in an otherwise &amp;lsquo;normal&amp;rsquo; acquisition context. Dr &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.clairenance.co.uk&#34;&gt;Claire Nance&lt;/a&gt; has in her &lt;a href=&#34;http://theses.gla.ac.uk/4603/&#34;&gt;thesis&lt;/a&gt; shown how we can use our knowledge of the processes of language variation and change to look at the Gaelic spoken in Glasgow&amp;rsquo;s Gaelic-language school. The conclusion here, again, is that while these varieties are influenced by English, they still behave like real, living languages do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should like to emphasize that this is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; some sort of professional &amp;lsquo;language-changes-deal-with-it&amp;rsquo; attitude that one sometimes has to adopt in the face of clueless pedantic hand-wringing about language. Of course, this is language change that happens in the social context of a majority-minority dynamic, so the adoption of new, English-influence norms might not necessarily be value-neutral. Nevertheless, I do find &amp;lsquo;new-speaker&amp;rsquo; Irish to be less objectionable than the idea that it might be somehow so inferior as not to merit any support at all. Of course it would be absolutely great if we could have a situation where urban Irish speakers have the opportunity to get enough input to acquire beautiful traditional Irish, but let&amp;rsquo;s face it &amp;mdash; neither polity on the island of Ireland has the political will to channel the kind of resources this would require. There is a lot that can &amp;mdash; and should &amp;mdash; be done to support the continued existence and future viability of traditional Irish-speaking communities, but to say that non-traditional varieties are little better than urban pidgins is, I think, counterproductive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing is: abandoning these speakers massively narrows the base from which the future of the language can be built. As the western Gaeltachtaí shrink, seeing Irish as a Gaeltacht matter is putting it on a path to oblivion. The state can only dedicate resources to the language as long as it has some sort of duty of care towards its speakers. Once Irish goes the way of Latin in society, it goes the same way in terms of funding for arts, university teaching, research, and all the rest &amp;mdash; it becomes a niche pursuit. In this context it is mad to say that just because Dubliners use English words and much prefer &lt;em&gt;tá sé ina dhochtúir&lt;/em&gt; (if they&amp;rsquo;re lucky) to wrangling with the copula they aren&amp;rsquo;t really Irish speakers. It&amp;rsquo;s not just a tactical mistake if you&amp;rsquo;re  a language campaigner &amp;mdash; it&amp;rsquo;s just not the right thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All that said, it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; of course imperative that the teaching of Irish (as with any other language, and &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; a minority language) equip the learners with as much knowledge of the &amp;lsquo;target&amp;rsquo; variety as possible. This, of course, requires resources, which aren&amp;rsquo;t really forthcoming just now, but &amp;mdash; in an ideal world &amp;mdash; there would be a rethinking of how the language is taught. Diarmuid Jonhson is right to point out that the Gaeltacht simply can&amp;rsquo;t produce the numbers of native-speaker teachers &amp;mdash; teacher training in the future will inevitably have to deal with L2 speakers, so a focus on the quality of the language pedagogy there is absolutely vital. And &amp;mdash; here&amp;rsquo;s a bit of &lt;em&gt;pro domo sua&lt;/em&gt; &amp;mdash; what is also sorely needed is a big programme of language documentation. To some extent, the teaching of Irish as a language has relied on the continuing availability of at least some L1 speakers in the profession. This has meant that the gap between language teaching and the linguistic study of the language &amp;mdash; as wide in Ireland as anywhere in the English-speaking world &amp;mdash; has not been at the top of people&amp;rsquo;s concerns. But we should be worried.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; academic descriptions of Irish &amp;mdash; mostly done in the mid to late 20th century, in line with the linguistic theories prevalent then &amp;mdash; and there is a wealth of archival material, but there is so, so much more than can and should be done. Linguistic science has come on massively since then, and without taking anything at all away from the achievements of these scholars, to whom we owe an eternal debt for documenting the language, we are now in a position to ask questions that would just not occur back then. And these are the sort of questions that a teacher should be able to answer if they come up &amp;mdash; and when the teacher is not a &amp;lsquo;traditional&amp;rsquo; speaker, how are they going to do it? As a very small example, I&amp;rsquo;m now engaged in research (with Dr &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ucd.ie/research/people/irishcelstirishflling/drmairenichiosain/&#34;&gt;Máire Ní Chiosáin&lt;/a&gt; of University College Dublin, with thanks to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.royalsoced.org.uk&#34;&gt;Royal Society of Edinburgh&lt;/a&gt; for funding) that, at bottom, addresses what you&amp;rsquo;d think was a fairly basic question &amp;mdash; how many vowels are there in Irish and Scottish Gaelic? The existing descriptions &amp;ndash; and some of them are truly excellent &amp;mdash; just don&amp;rsquo;t contain the sort of data that would allow us to answer this apparently innocuous question reliably. And don&amp;rsquo;t get me started on syntax, which for now an advanced learner can really only acquire by way of osmosis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just one example of the disconnect between school- and even university-level pedagogy and linguistic research, but I think it&amp;rsquo;s really, really worrying in this minority-language context. My colleagues in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/literatures-languages-cultures/celtic-scottish-studies&#34;&gt;Celtic &amp;amp; Scottish Studies&lt;/a&gt;  here at Edinburgh hope to begin addressing this by including a linguistics component in their new degree in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/literatures-languages-cultures/celtic-scottish-studies/undergraduate/gaelic-and-primary-education/overview&#34;&gt;Gaelic and Primary Education&lt;/a&gt;, but this is only a start, and anyway there is just so much more of the actual research that needs done on these languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in any case, even this little self-serving rant aside, the phenomenon (I&amp;rsquo;m carefully avoiding saying &amp;lsquo;problem&amp;rsquo;) Diarmuid Johnson has identified is real enough: the education systems patently do not give the learners the amount of exposure to traditional varieties for them to be acquired reliably. This should, of course, be remedied &amp;mdash; it probably won&amp;rsquo;t any time soon, realistically, but one can always hope. But even if it isn&amp;rsquo;t, new-speaker Irish (or Gaelic, or Welsh, or your minority language of choice) is here to stay, and its speakers are friends to the language, not a blight on the landscape. Even if their Irish is imperfect by the high standards of the past, they deserve help and support.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Irish isn’t ‘compromised’ — it just needs more support</title>
<link>http://anghyflawn.github.io/blog/2015/irish-isnt-compromised-it-just-needs-more-support/</link>
<pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
<guid>http://anghyflawn.github.io/blog/2015/irish-isnt-compromised-it-just-needs-more-support/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;There is a very interesting article now up on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sluggerotoole.com&#34;&gt;Slugger O&amp;rsquo;Toole&lt;/a&gt;, based around an interview with Dr &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.diarmuidjohnson.net&#34;&gt;Diarmuid Johnson&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=&#34;http://sluggerotoole.com/2015/07/26/do-urban-gaeltachts-produce-a-compromised-irish&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do urban Gaeltachts produce a compromised Irish?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Go read it now &amp;mdash; it&amp;rsquo;s well written and very well informed, especially if you compare it to the general level of debate around in the Irish language in Northern Ireland (as some &amp;mdash; though by no means all &amp;mdash; comments demonstrate).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full disclosure &amp;mdash; I&amp;rsquo;m an admirer of Diarmuid Johnson, and I owe him a debt of gratitude for the kind assistance I received from him in the course of my own research in  West Wales. Nevertheless, I do think that Barton Creeth is on to something in the final paragraph, saying&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be many who argue Johnson’s purism about the language is
misplaced. [&amp;hellip;] What we have in Belfast, in terms of language
revival, is probably as good as it gets, and other minority language
activists can learn a lot from the Belfast experience. The hybrid,
urban, pidginised and creolised Irish of Belfast, Dublin, Derry and
other cities across Ireland is probably the future of the language,
and it likely means a new chapter in the history of the language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s really jagging for me is the use of &amp;lsquo;compromised&amp;rsquo; to describe the non-traditional (&amp;lsquo;urban&amp;rsquo;) varieties of Irish. I suspect it starts out as an aesthetic judgement of someone very familiar with traditional Irish, but equally I suspect being perceived by many &amp;mdash; including those outside the &amp;lsquo;movement&amp;rsquo; &amp;mdash; as a value judgement. Indeed, in that same paragraph we find the burden of justification being laid squarely on the minority language users:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, parents and educators need to seriously think about
the source of Irish in Irish-medium education, and whether
Irish-medium education, in its current form, offers children the
best possible resources to fully develop intellectually and
emotionally. I’ll look forward to hearing the responses from people
who work in Irish Medium Education as well as from urban language
activists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s be honest for a moment: would we be hearing these challenges to prove that bilingualism offers the &amp;lsquo;best possible resources&amp;rsquo; for the &amp;lsquo;full development&amp;rsquo; of children if the language in question were a &amp;lsquo;major world language&amp;rsquo; rather than a minority one with a history of political string attachment?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt that traditional varieties of Irish as spoken in the Gaeltacht are under severe pressure as it finds its position weakened as a community language. An increasing proportion of those who use Irish are &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nspk.org.uk/&#34;&gt;&amp;lsquo;new speakers&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a&gt;, with relatively little access to traditional Irish as their input in language learning (as Johnson rightly points out). Indeed, some scholars, such as Dr &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dias.ie/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=576%3Adr-brian-o-curnain&amp;amp;catid=19%3Acelticstaff&amp;amp;Itemid=17&amp;amp;lang=en&#34;&gt;Brian Ó Curnáin&lt;/a&gt; at DIAS, have argued that the point of no return for traditional varieties of Irish is very close or already past, and &amp;lsquo;new-speaker&amp;rsquo; Irish is what we&amp;rsquo;re stuck with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New-speaker Irish is undoubtedly different from traditional Irish in many respects. It&amp;rsquo;s interesting, however, to look at how exactly it is different. For most people, I suspect, the most appalling sign of decline is the use of English borrowings (after all, for the average layperson, language equals vocabulary) and calques, as people complain about Gaelscoil kids saying things like &lt;em&gt;tá sin ag déanamh mo cheann isteach&lt;/em&gt;. But acquiring a language is, of course, much more than acquiring the words: it&amp;rsquo;s also about the grammatical structures and the different ways language is used in society. Some of the available research, such as that from Prof. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ulster.ac.uk/staff/am.henry.html&#34;&gt;Alison Henry&lt;/a&gt; at Ulster University (disclosure: a former colleague) has shown that to the extent learners in Irish-medium education do not attain the target state, this shows patterns associated not with some sort of terribly monstrous unnatural language but with the lack of sufficient input in an otherwise &amp;lsquo;normal&amp;rsquo; acquisition context. Dr &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.clairenance.co.uk&#34;&gt;Claire Nance&lt;/a&gt; has in her &lt;a href=&#34;http://theses.gla.ac.uk/4603/&#34;&gt;thesis&lt;/a&gt; shown how we can use our knowledge of the processes of language variation and change to look at the Gaelic spoken in Glasgow&amp;rsquo;s Gaelic-language school. The conclusion here, again, is that while these varieties are influenced by English, they still behave like real, living languages do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should like to emphasize that this is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; some sort of professional &amp;lsquo;language-changes-deal-with-it&amp;rsquo; attitude that one sometimes has to adopt in the face of clueless pedantic hand-wringing about language. Of course, this is language change that happens in the social context of a majority-minority dynamic, so the adoption of new, English-influence norms might not necessarily be value-neutral. Nevertheless, I do find &amp;lsquo;new-speaker&amp;rsquo; Irish to be less objectionable than the idea that it might be somehow so inferior as not to merit any support at all. Of course it would be absolutely great if we could have a situation where urban Irish speakers have the opportunity to get enough input to acquire beautiful traditional Irish, but let&amp;rsquo;s face it &amp;mdash; neither polity on the island of Ireland has the political will to channel the kind of resources this would require. There is a lot that can &amp;mdash; and should &amp;mdash; be done to support the continued existence and future viability of traditional Irish-speaking communities, but to say that non-traditional varieties are little better than urban pidgins is, I think, counterproductive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing is: abandoning these speakers massively narrows the base from which the future of the language can be built. As the western Gaeltachtaí shrink, seeing Irish as a Gaeltacht matter is putting it on a path to oblivion. The state can only dedicate resources to the language as long as it has some sort of duty of care towards its speakers. Once Irish goes the way of Latin in society, it goes the same way in terms of funding for arts, university teaching, research, and all the rest &amp;mdash; it becomes a niche pursuit. In this context it is mad to say that just because Dubliners use English words and much prefer &lt;em&gt;tá sé ina dhochtúir&lt;/em&gt; (if they&amp;rsquo;re lucky) to wrangling with the copula they aren&amp;rsquo;t really Irish speakers. It&amp;rsquo;s not just a tactical mistake if you&amp;rsquo;re  a language campaigner &amp;mdash; it&amp;rsquo;s just not the right thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;

My colleagues in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/literatures-languages-cultures/celtic-scottish-studies&#34;&gt;Celtic &amp;amp; Scottish Studies&lt;/a&gt;  here at Edinburgh hope to begin addressing this by including a linguistics component in their new degree in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/literatures-languages-cultures/celtic-scottish-studies/undergraduate/gaelic-and-primary-education/overview&#34;&gt;Gaelic and Primary Education&lt;/a&gt;, but this is only a start, and anyway there is just so much more of the actual research that needs done on these languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in any case, even this little self-serving rant aside, the phenomenon (I&amp;rsquo;m carefully avoiding saying &amp;lsquo;problem&amp;rsquo;) Diarmuid Johnson has identified is real enough: the education systems patently do not give the learners the amount of exposure to traditional varieties for them to be acquired reliably. This should, of course, be remedied &amp;mdash; it probably won&amp;rsquo;t any time soon, realistically, but one can always hope. But even if it isn&amp;rsquo;t, new-speaker Irish (or Gaelic, or Welsh, or your minority language of choice) is here to stay, and its speakers are friends to the language, not a blight on the landscape. Even if their Irish is imperfect by the high standards of the past, they deserve help and support.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Irish isn’t ‘compromised’ — it just needs more support</title>
<link>http://anghyflawn.github.io/blog/2015/irish-isnt-compromised-it-just-needs-more-support/</link>
<pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
<guid>http://anghyflawn.github.io/blog/2015/irish-isnt-compromised-it-just-needs-more-support/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;There is a very interesting article now up on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sluggerotoole.com&#34;&gt;Slugger O&amp;rsquo;Toole&lt;/a&gt;, based around an interview with Dr &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.diarmuidjohnson.net&#34;&gt;Diarmuid Johnson&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=&#34;http://sluggerotoole.com/2015/07/26/do-urban-gaeltachts-produce-a-compromised-irish&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do urban Gaeltachts produce a compromised Irish?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Go read it now &amp;mdash; it&amp;rsquo;s well written and very well informed, especially if you compare it to the general level of debate around in the Irish language in Northern Ireland (as some &amp;mdash; though by no means all &amp;mdash; comments demonstrate).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full disclosure &amp;mdash; I&amp;rsquo;m an admirer of Diarmuid Johnson, and I owe him a debt of gratitude for the kind assistance I received from him in the course of my own research in  West Wales. Nevertheless, I do think that Barton Creeth is on to something in the final paragraph, saying&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be many who argue Johnson’s purism about the language is
misplaced. [&amp;hellip;] What we have in Belfast, in terms of language
revival, is probably as good as it gets, and other minority language
activists can learn a lot from the Belfast experience. The hybrid,
urban, pidginised and creolised Irish of Belfast, Dublin, Derry and
other cities across Ireland is probably the future of the language,
and it likely means a new chapter in the history of the language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s really jagging for me is the use of &amp;lsquo;compromised&amp;rsquo; to describe the non-traditional (&amp;lsquo;urban&amp;rsquo;) varieties of Irish. I suspect it starts out as an aesthetic judgement of someone very familiar with traditional Irish, but equally I suspect being perceived by many &amp;mdash; including those outside the &amp;lsquo;movement&amp;rsquo; &amp;mdash; as a value judgement. Indeed, in that same paragraph we find the burden of justification being laid squarely on the minority language users:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, parents and educators need to seriously think about
the source of Irish in Irish-medium education, and whether
Irish-medium education, in its current form, offers children the
best possible resources to fully develop intellectually and
emotionally. I’ll look forward to hearing the responses from people
who work in Irish Medium Education as well as from urban language
activists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s be honest for a moment: would we be hearing these challenges to prove that bilingualism offers the &amp;lsquo;best possible resources&amp;rsquo; for the &amp;lsquo;full development&amp;rsquo; of children if the language in question were a &amp;lsquo;major world language&amp;rsquo; rather than a minority one with a history of political string attachment?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt that traditional varieties of Irish as spoken in the Gaeltacht are under severe pressure as it finds its position weakened as a community language. An increasing proportion of those who use Irish are &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nspk.org.uk/&#34;&gt;&amp;lsquo;new speakers&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a&gt;, with relatively little access to traditional Irish as their input in language learning (as Johnson rightly points out). Indeed, some scholars, such as Dr &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dias.ie/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=576%3Adr-brian-o-curnain&amp;amp;catid=19%3Acelticstaff&amp;amp;Itemid=17&amp;amp;lang=en&#34;&gt;Brian Ó Curnáin&lt;/a&gt; at DIAS, have argued that the point of no return for traditional varieties of Irish is very close or already past, and &amp;lsquo;new-speaker&amp;rsquo; Irish is what we&amp;rsquo;re stuck with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New-speaker Irish is undoubtedly different from traditional Irish in many respects. It&amp;rsquo;s interesting, however, to look at how exactly it is different. For most people, I suspect, the most appalling sign of decline is the use of English borrowings (after all, for the average layperson, language equals vocabulary) and calques, as people complain about Gaelscoil kids saying things like &lt;em&gt;tá sin ag déanamh mo cheann isteach&lt;/em&gt;. But acquiring a language is, of course, much more than acquiring the words: it&amp;rsquo;s also about the grammatical structures and the different ways language is used in society. Some of the available research, such as that from Prof. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ulster.ac.uk/staff/am.henry.html&#34;&gt;Alison Henry&lt;/a&gt; at Ulster University (disclosure: a former colleague) has shown that to the extent learners in Irish-medium education do not attain the target state, this shows patterns associated not with some sort of terribly monstrous unnatural language but with the lack of sufficient input in an otherwise &amp;lsquo;normal&amp;rsquo; acquisition context. Dr &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.clairenance.co.uk&#34;&gt;Claire Nance&lt;/a&gt; has in her &lt;a href=&#34;http://theses.gla.ac.uk/4603/&#34;&gt;thesis&lt;/a&gt; shown how we can use our knowledge of the processes of language variation and change to look at the Gaelic spoken in Glasgow&amp;rsquo;s Gaelic-language school. The conclusion here, again, is that while these varieties are influenced by English, they still behave like real, living languages do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should like to emphasize that this is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; some sort of professional &amp;lsquo;language-changes-deal-with-it&amp;rsquo; attitude that one sometimes has to adopt in the face of clueless pedantic hand-wringing about language. Of course, this is language change that happens in the social context of a majority-minority dynamic, so the adoption of new, English-influence norms might not necessarily be value-neutral. Nevertheless, I do find &amp;lsquo;new-speaker&amp;rsquo; Irish to be less objectionable than the idea that it might be somehow so inferior as not to merit any support at all. Of course it would be absolutely great if we could have a situation where urban Irish speakers have the opportunity to get enough input to acquire beautiful traditional Irish, but let&amp;rsquo;s face it &amp;mdash; neither polity on the island of Ireland has the political will to channel the kind of resources this would require. There is a lot that can &amp;mdash; and should &amp;mdash; be done to support the continued existence and future viability of traditional Irish-speaking communities, but to say that non-traditional varieties are little better than urban pidgins is, I think, counterproductive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing is: abandoning these speakers massively narrows the base from which the future of the language can be built. As the western Gaeltachtaí shrink, seeing Irish as a Gaeltacht matter is putting it on a path to oblivion. The state can only dedicate resources to the language as long as it has some sort of duty of care towards its speakers. Once Irish goes the way of Latin in society, it goes the same way in terms of funding for arts, university teaching, research, and all the rest &amp;mdash; it becomes a niche pursuit. In this context it is mad to say that just because Dubliners use English words and much prefer &lt;em&gt;tá sé ina dhochtúir&lt;/em&gt; (if they&amp;rsquo;re lucky) to wrangling with the copula they aren&amp;rsquo;t really Irish speakers. It&amp;rsquo;s not just a tactical mistake if you&amp;rsquo;re  a language campaigner &amp;mdash; it&amp;rsquo;s just not the right thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All that said, it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; of course imperative that the teaching of Irish (as with any other language, and &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; a minority language) equip the learners with as much knowledge of the &amp;lsquo;target&amp;rsquo; variety as possible. This, of course, requires resources, which aren&amp;rsquo;t really forthcoming just now, but &amp;mdash; in an ideal world &amp;mdash; there would be a rethinking of how the language is taught. Diarmuid Jonhson is right to point out that the Gaeltacht simply can&amp;rsquo;t produce the numbers of native-speaker teachers &amp;mdash; teacher training in the future will inevitably have to deal with L2 speakers, so a focus on the quality of the language pedagogy there is absolutely vital. And &amp;mdash; here&amp;rsquo;s a bit of &lt;em&gt;pro domo sua&lt;/em&gt; &amp;mdash; what is also sorely needed is a big programme of language documentation. To some extent, the teaching of Irish as a language has relied on the continuing availability of at least some L1 speakers in the profession. This has meant that the gap between language teaching and the linguistic study of the language &amp;mdash; as wide in Ireland as anywhere in the English-speaking world &amp;mdash; has not been at the top of people&amp;rsquo;s concerns. But we should be worried.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; academic descriptions of Irish &amp;mdash; mostly done in the mid to late 20th century, in line with the linguistic theories prevalent then &amp;mdash; and there is a wealth of archival material, but there is so, so much more than can and should be done. Linguistic science has come on massively since then, and without taking anything at all away from the achievements of these scholars, to whom we owe an eternal debt for documenting the language, we are now in a position to ask questions that would just not occur back then. And these are the sort of questions that a teacher should be able to answer if they come up &amp;mdash; and when the teacher is not a &amp;lsquo;traditional&amp;rsquo; speaker, how are they going to do it? As a very small example, I&amp;rsquo;m now engaged in research (with Dr &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ucd.ie/research/people/irishcelstirishflling/drmairenichiosain/&#34;&gt;Máire Ní Chiosáin&lt;/a&gt; of University College Dublin, with thanks to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.royalsoced.org.uk&#34;&gt;Royal Society of Edinburgh&lt;/a&gt; for funding) that, at bottom, addresses what you&amp;rsquo;d think was a fairly basic question &amp;mdash; how many vowels are there in Irish and Scottish Gaelic? The existing descriptions &amp;ndash; and some of them are truly excellent &amp;mdash; just don&amp;rsquo;t contain the sort of data that would allow us to answer this apparently innocuous question reliably. And don&amp;rsquo;t get me started on syntax, which for now an advanced learner can really only acquire by way of osmosis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just one example of the disconnect between school- and even university-level pedagogy and linguistic research, but I think it&amp;rsquo;s really, really worrying in this minority-language context. My colleagues in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/literatures-languages-cultures/celtic-scottish-studies&#34;&gt;Celtic &amp;amp; Scottish Studies&lt;/a&gt;  here at Edinburgh hope to begin addressing this by including a linguistics component in their new degree in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/literatures-languages-cultures/celtic-scottish-studies/undergraduate/gaelic-and-primary-education/overview&#34;&gt;Gaelic and Primary Education&lt;/a&gt;, but this is only a start, and anyway there is just so much more of the actual research that needs done on these languages.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Preaspiration and tonal accents as Northern Gaelic features</title>
<link>http://anghyflawn.github.io/presentation/2015/pitch-accent-and-preaspiration-in-gaelic-reconsidering-contact-origins/</link>
<pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
<guid>http://anghyflawn.github.io/presentation/2015/pitch-accent-and-preaspiration-in-gaelic-reconsidering-contact-origins/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I argue that the origin of both pitch accents and preaspiration in Gaelic is best understood in the context of a &amp;lsquo;Northern Gaelic&amp;rsquo; area covering Ulster and Scotland, as opposed to Connacht and Munster. Within this area, both preaspiration and pitch accents show the classic pattern of peripheral archaisms, with Lewis and West Ulster as remnant areas and Argyll as the most innovative zone. This suggests that the stronger Norse presence in the Hebrides does not correlate with a denser distribution of potential contact features, and thus the developments in both cases need not have been triggered by contact &amp;mdash; even though a reinforcing role for contact is very difficult (and probably undesirable) to exclude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The handout is slightly more detailed than the slides. Note that the file is quite large because of the maps.&lt;/p&gt;

<guid>http://anghyflawn.github.io/presentation/2015/free-not-so-free-dialect-variation-quantity-quality-interactions-welsh-vowels/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I offer an analysis of &amp;lsquo;length&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;tenseness&amp;rsquo; found in an acoustic study of eight speakers. The results confirm the existence of a categorical pattern whereby the quality of long mid vowels in penults depends on the phonological height of the following vowel (Awbery 1984, Wmffre 2003). One speaker shows a distribution of tenseness that categorically tracks length in penults, much as described in the literature and shown for monosyllables by Mayr &amp;amp; Davies (2011). Finally, one speaker shows a fairly robust duration distinction between &amp;lsquo;long&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;short&amp;rsquo; vowels but no qualitative distinction, consistently producing &amp;lsquo;lax&amp;rsquo; vowels irrespective of phonological quantity. I suggest that this latter system is historically original (contrary to the suggestions of Wmffre 2003, who sees lax vowels in words like &lt;em&gt;cefn&lt;/em&gt; as a result of a lowering process, and of Rees 2013, who suggests that tensing of short vowels in penults precedes their lengthening). Finally, I offer a brief comparison of penults with unstressed vowels, which, contrary to descriptions, appear to show little continuous (or discrete variation), with non-trivial phonological consequences. Much of the presentation is similar to my &lt;a href=&#34;http://anghyflawn.github.io/presentation/2015/quantity-quality-interactions-in-welsh-vowels-phonologization-across-dialects/&#34;&gt;23mfm talk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Quantity-quality interactions in Welsh vowels</title>
<link>http://anghyflawn.github.io/presentation/2015/quantity-quality-interactions-in-welsh-vowels-phonologization-across-dialects/</link>
<pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
<guid>http://anghyflawn.github.io/presentation/2015/quantity-quality-interactions-in-welsh-vowels-phonologization-across-dialects/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I present the results of a phonetic study of the relationship between vowel quality and vowel quantity. The results confirm that the descriptions are correct in setting up a categorical distinction between two varieties of long mid vowels (tense [eː oː] and lax [ɛː ɔː]) in South-West Welsh. This system plausibly arose as the enhancement of a pattern where there is no quality distinctions between short and long vowels, with continuous variation in height in both prosodic contexts. The rise of the south-western pattern is connected to the phonologization of a trading relation in duration between the stressed penultimate and the final syllable, which is still attested in the relevant varieties. This presents an interesting example of &amp;lsquo;rule scattering&amp;rsquo; (Bermúdez-Otero 2014).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The handout is much more detailed than the slides. However, there is a rather embarrassing misinterpretation of the durational effect for the &amp;lsquo;non-enhanced&amp;rsquo; system. I&amp;rsquo;m leaving this unchanged in the interest of historical veracity, but see my &lt;a href=&#34;http://anghyflawn.github.io/presentation/2015/free-not-so-free-dialect-variation-quantity-quality-interactions-welsh-vowels/&#34;&gt;Gregynog presentation&lt;/a&gt;, once it&amp;rsquo;s available, for the corrected version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I plan on releasing the data behind this presentation fairly soon &amp;mdash; check back later for a link.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper sets out in detail the analysis first offered in my &lt;a href=&#34;http://anghyflawn.github.io/presentation/2013/non-contrastive-epenthetic-segments-as-surface-prosodic-structure/&#34;&gt;21mfm presentation&lt;/a&gt;. I examine the so-called &amp;lsquo;short-vowel stød&amp;rsquo; (&lt;em&gt;kortvokalstød&lt;/em&gt;) found in certain island dialects of Danish, which differs from the &amp;lsquo;common Danish&amp;rsquo; stød in that it is associated with light syllables (open syllable with short vowels or closed syllables with low-sonority codas) rather than heavy ones. I argue that it is best represented as a [constricted glottis] feature associated with a segmentally empty mora, which is projected due to top-down requirements on the internal structure of suprasegmental constituents. Thus, stød is interpreted as another example of a &amp;lsquo;tonal accent&amp;rsquo; phenomenon that submits to an analysis purely in terms of lexically stored metrical structure. I also offer an extension of the model which allows the direct association of features to suprasegmental constituents to Icelandic preaspiration.&lt;/p&gt;

With Emacs, this means I have access to both the awesome AUCTeX for writing LaTeX and the excellent ESS environment for the statistics at the same time. However, being the absent-minded academic that I am, I sometimes end up opening the woven &lt;code&gt;.tex&lt;/code&gt; file instead of the &lt;code&gt;.Rnw&lt;/code&gt; and make edits to that, which means it gets overwritten and lost the next time I run &lt;code&gt;knitr&lt;/code&gt;. This is suboptimal, but of course Emacs allows us to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can be achieved by &lt;em&gt;advising&lt;/em&gt; the relevant function &amp;mdash; in this case &lt;code&gt;switch-to-buffer&lt;/code&gt;. The following bit of Elisp code will ask you when you&amp;rsquo;re trying to switch to a buffer with a &lt;code&gt;.tex&lt;/code&gt; file when there&amp;rsquo;s a corresponding &lt;code&gt;.Rnw&lt;/code&gt; file open at the some time. It&amp;rsquo;s not particularly robust (e.g. it doesn&amp;rsquo;t take cognizance of multiple buffers visiting files of the same name), but it gets the basic job done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-lisp&#34;&gt;        (defun tex-Rnw-check (name)
          &amp;quot;When opening a .tex file, check to make sure there isn&#39;t a
      corresponding .Rnw available, to make sure we don&#39;t try to edit
      the wrong file.&amp;quot;
          (when (and (bufferp name)
                     (buffer-file-name name))
            (let* ((rnw-file (format &amp;quot;%s.Rnw&amp;quot; (file-name-sans-extension (buffer-file-name name)))))
              (when (and (equal (file-name-extension (buffer-file-name name)) &amp;quot;tex&amp;quot;)
                         (member rnw-file (mapcar #&#39;buffer-file-name (buffer-list))))
                (if (yes-or-no-p &amp;quot;You are trying to open a .tex file, but the corresponding .Rnw file seems to be open. Are you sure?&amp;quot;)
                    name
                  (find-buffer-visiting rnw-file))))))
      
        (defadvice switch-to-buffer (around noweb-check activate)
          (let ((buffer-or-name (or (tex-Rnw-check (ad-get-arg 0))
                                    (ad-get-arg 0))))
            ad-do-it))
        (ad-update &#39;switch-to-buffer)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This uses the old &lt;code&gt;defadvice&lt;/code&gt; mechanism rather than the new &lt;code&gt;add-function&lt;/code&gt;, but seems to work well enough. (I&amp;rsquo;m stuck on Emacs 24.3, as later versions seems to have funky bugs with the display of some Unicode characters that I badly need.)&lt;/p&gt;

<title>About my name</title>
<link>http://anghyflawn.github.io/my-name/</link>
<pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
<guid>http://anghyflawn.github.io/my-name/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;My name is obviously problematic for English speakers (or indeed for Russian speakers), so I&amp;rsquo;m just putting this up for future reference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Russian, my surname is Иосад, pronounced in Modern Standard Russian as something like [i.aˈsat] &amp;mdash; that&amp;rsquo;s two onsetless syllables in a row, plus final devoicing. English speakers rightly ignore the final devoicing, but the two first syllables can still be a problem. The suggested version for English speakers is [ˈjɔːsəd], with the vowel of &lt;em&gt;thought&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a sense, this is nothing but reverting to the historical origins of the name. It is originally Jewish, possibly deriving from Hebrew יסד, and pronounced with an initial [j]. In pre-Revolutionary Russia, &amp;lsquo;my&amp;rsquo; version of the name would have been written Iосадъ, because of the rule that prohibited writing any version of И (including Й, the expected spelling for [j]) before a vowel (see e.g. &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dotted_I_(Cyrillic&#34;&gt;this Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt;). After the spelling reform which abolished I/i in Cyrillic, the name was automatically respelled as Иосад rather than the more correct Йосад. (The same fate befell the words for &lt;em&gt;ion&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;iodine&lt;/em&gt;, which are still spelt &lt;em&gt;ион&lt;/em&gt; and, occasionally, &lt;em&gt;иод&lt;/em&gt;, despite being pronounced with [j].) I suppose at some stage my family gave up on correcting people and adopted the spelling pronunciation. So, now you know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;https://sites.google.com/site/erschler/&#34;&gt;David Erschler&lt;/a&gt; for help with the Hebrew.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;Here you will find some material related to my PhD thesis entitled &lt;em&gt;Representation and variation in substance-free phonology&lt;/em&gt;, which I submitted to the University of Tromsø on 3rd August 2012 and which I successfully defended in a &lt;em&gt;viva voce&lt;/em&gt; examination on 18th February 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The official version of the thesis can be downloaded from &lt;a href=&#34;http://munin.uit.no&#34;&gt;Munin&lt;/a&gt;, the University of Tromsø&amp;rsquo;s institutional repository, &lt;a href=&#34;http://hdl.handle.net/10037/4794&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can download the LaTeX source code for the thesis &lt;a href=&#34;http://code.anghyflawn.net/phd-thesis&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is an &lt;a href=&#34;http://uit.no/ansatte/organisasjon/nyhetsartikkel?p_document_id=325183&amp;amp;p_dimension_id=88147&amp;amp;p_menu=28723&amp;amp;p_lang=2&#34;&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; I did for the faculty&amp;rsquo;s web site (it is in Norwegian).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://anghyflawn.github.io/pdf/viva.presentation.pdf&#34;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is the handout for the short presentation of the thesis&amp;rsquo; main results that I had to do for the viva.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Norwegian doctoral defence is accompanied by a &amp;lsquo;trial lecture&amp;rsquo; (&lt;em&gt;prøveforelesning&lt;/em&gt;) on a topic of the committee&amp;rsquo;s choosing. &lt;a href=&#34;http://anghyflawn.github.io/pdf/viva.lecture.pdf&#34;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is the handout for mine, entitled &lt;em&gt;Progress and problems in language revitalization: The Celtic languages&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

<title>Welsh svarabhakti as stem allomorphy</title>
<link>http://anghyflawn.github.io/writing/svarabhakti/</link>
<pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
<guid>http://anghyflawn.github.io/writing/svarabhakti/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper develops the analysis in &lt;a href=&#34;http://anghyflawn.github.io/presentation/2012/the-phonological-endgame-welsh-svarabhakti-revisited/&#34;&gt;this presentation&lt;/a&gt;. I offer an analysis of Welsh epenthesis, whereby a copy of a preceding vowel is inserted to break up final clusters of rising sonority (&lt;em&gt;pwdr&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lsquo;rotten&amp;rsquo; is [pudur] rather than *[pudr]) and deletion in such clusters in polysyllables (&lt;em&gt;perygl&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lsquo;danger&amp;rsquo; is [perɪɡ] rather than *[perɪɡl]). It has previously been argued that both processes can be analysed in a single phonological grammar. I show that this is not tenable for South Welsh dialects, and propose an analysis in terms of part-of-speech-specific allomorphy, formalized as lexical storage of POS-characterized stems rather than roots.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>An echoing tone</title>
<link>http://anghyflawn.github.io/presentation/2015/an-echoing-tone-pitch-accent-parallels-in-scandinavia-and-scotland/</link>
<pubDate>Sun, 01 Mar 2015 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
<guid>http://anghyflawn.github.io/presentation/2015/an-echoing-tone-pitch-accent-parallels-in-scandinavia-and-scotland/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;This talk was presented at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nordicresearchnetwork.co.uk&#34;&gt;Nordic Research Network 2015 conference&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ed.ac.uk&#34;&gt;University of Edinburgh&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I consider the origins of pitch accents in North Germanic and in Scottish Gaelic. I argue that in both cases the more plausible hypothesis involves the realization of an identical tonal melody over different temporal domains, particularly by the mechanism of peak delay. This is not a new idea, but I support it by a consideration of the interaction of tone and apocope in Zealand Danish and in Central Scandinavian. The application of this mechanism to Gaelic shows that tonal accents found in places like Lewis are a special case of a system that is widely spread in Ulster and Scotland, with Argyll and East Ulster as an innovating centre &amp;mdash; recourse to contact with Norse is not necessary to explain their appearance. Find the slides below, or download the &lt;i class=&#34;fa fa-file-pdf-o&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://anghyflawn.github.io/pdf/nrn2015.handout.pdf&#34;&gt;handout&lt;/a&gt;, which is slightly more detailed.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Getting off the Word standard: Your academic life in plain text</title>
<link>http://anghyflawn.github.io/teaching/2015/ilw-pandoc/</link>
<pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>

<description>

&lt;p&gt;These notes are from a workshop on &lt;code&gt;pandoc&lt;/code&gt; I ran for Innovative Learning Week 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-is-this-about:c5823fcb8a1263e1354441821c807a9f&#34;&gt;What is this about?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can get the PDF file produced with &lt;code&gt;pandoc&lt;/code&gt; from the same source as this page &lt;a href=&#34;http://anghyflawn.github.io/pdf/pandoc.notes.pdf&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;some-terminology:c5823fcb8a1263e1354441821c807a9f&#34;&gt;Some terminology&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;pandoc&lt;/code&gt; is the program written by the philosopher John MacFarlane to convert texts between different formats&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;pandoc&lt;/code&gt; is able to take files in a variety of formats and produce output in an even bigger variety of formats&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;markdown&lt;/code&gt; is a lightweight &lt;em&gt;mark-up&lt;/em&gt; language

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It was originally created to simplify the creation of HTML pages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With pandoc, you can use it to produce a variety of outputs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can also use other input formats, but we focus on &lt;code&gt;markdown&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The most relevant output formats for us are

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;docx&lt;/code&gt;, i.e. Word&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;tex&lt;/code&gt;, which &lt;code&gt;pandoc&lt;/code&gt; uses internally to produce &lt;code&gt;PDF&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Isn&amp;rsquo;t this like TeX?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is: TeX is another type of mark-up language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The LaTeX system is &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; powerful than &lt;code&gt;pandoc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, it has a much steeper learning curve&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This code will produce a presentation slide with a nested bullet list with the LaTeX package &lt;code&gt;beamer&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-latex&#34;&gt;\begin{frame}{Slide title}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Item 1
  \item Item 2
  \begin{itemize}
      \item Subitem 1
      \item Subitem 2
  \end{itemize}
  \item Item 3
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same code will be produced if you run &lt;code&gt;pandoc&lt;/code&gt; to produce &lt;code&gt;beamer&lt;/code&gt; output on the following &lt;code&gt;markdown&lt;/code&gt; fragment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-markdown&#34;&gt;## Slide title ##

* Item 1
* Item 2
    * Subitem 1
    * Subitem 2
* Item 3

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many LaTeX users do not really use its full capabilities, but stick to it because of the superior æsthetic qualities of its output compared to more standard software&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With &lt;code&gt;pandoc&lt;/code&gt;, you can get LaTeX typography without ever touching the LaTeX code: &lt;code&gt;pandoc&lt;/code&gt; creates perfectly serviceable LaTeX code and can run LaTeX for you to produce a PDF file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is how these notes were made&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-pandoc:c5823fcb8a1263e1354441821c807a9f&#34;&gt;Why &lt;code&gt;pandoc&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flexibility of output (unlike LaTeX)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simple mark-up, no point-and-click (similar to LaTeX)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy to achieve consistency of styling thanks to logical mark-up (similar to LaTeX)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reliability: all your sources are in &lt;em&gt;plain text&lt;/em&gt; (like LaTeX)

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No file corruptions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Guaranteed portability between systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No need to fire up and fight Word or similar word processing programs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cross-platform stability: write your essay on your iPad&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automation of common tasks

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Numbering and cross-referencing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keeping track of citations vs. references&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automated typesetting of bibliographies using defined styles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basic support for TeX constructs (notably mathematical symbols)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;getting-started:c5823fcb8a1263e1354441821c807a9f&#34;&gt;Getting started&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-pandoc-workflow:c5823fcb8a1263e1354441821c807a9f&#34;&gt;The &lt;code&gt;pandoc&lt;/code&gt; workflow&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For an example of a Markdown source file, grab the source of these notes &lt;a href=&#34;http://anghyflawn.github.io/md/pandoc.notes.md&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (and the picture &lt;a href=&#34;http://anghyflawn.github.io/img/kiparsky.png&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You edit your files in a &lt;em&gt;text editor&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This can be Notepad on Windows or TextEdit on OS X, but there are editors with good &lt;code&gt;markdown&lt;/code&gt; support built-in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OS X: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.macromates.com&#34;&gt;TextMate&lt;/a&gt; is a good choice; there are also plenty of bespoke Markdown-writing apps around, but they are often not free&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Windows: something that is frequently recommended is &lt;a href=&#34;http://notepad-plus-plus.org&#34;&gt;Notepad++&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.guidingtech.com/31357/notepad-plus-plugins/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; are some notes about enabling &lt;code&gt;markdown&lt;/code&gt; support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generally, Google is your friend for these things&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are also the two cross-platform editors &lt;code&gt;Emacs&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Vim&lt;/code&gt;. They are very powerful and have excellent support for both &lt;code&gt;markdown&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;pandoc&lt;/code&gt;. I would not recommend learning &lt;code&gt;markdown&lt;/code&gt; and one of these editors &lt;em&gt;at the same time&lt;/em&gt; (or at least with any sort of deadline looming!), but that is my recommendation. Gentler introductions to Emacs are available in the shape of &lt;a href=&#34;http:/www.aquamacs.org&#34;&gt;Aquamacs&lt;/a&gt; (this is essentially Emacs with a slightly more traditional interface; OS X only) and &lt;a href=&#34;http://kieranhealy.org/resources/emacs-starter-kit/&#34;&gt;Kieran Healy&amp;rsquo;s Emacs Starter Kit&lt;/a&gt;, specifically geared towards social scientists (close enough to linguistics!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once you have written your file, you &lt;em&gt;run&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;pandoc&lt;/code&gt;. There is no graphical user interface (unless you use Emacs or Vim&amp;hellip;), so the program must be run in the command line

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OS X: Applications &amp;gt; Utilities &amp;gt; Terminal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Windows: run &lt;code&gt;cmd&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;powershell&lt;/code&gt; to open the Terminal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To navigate to where your files are, use the command &lt;code&gt;cd&lt;/code&gt;, e.g. &lt;code&gt;cd ~/Documents/Essays&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt; is an abbreviation for &lt;code&gt;/Users/&amp;lt;your username&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, i.e. your home folder) or &lt;code&gt;cd C:\Users\&amp;lt;your name&amp;gt;\Documents&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To avoid typing out long folder names, type the first characters of the name of the folder you&amp;rsquo;re looking for and press &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;TAB&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; to auto-complete the path&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once you are in the same folder as your files, you are ready to run &lt;code&gt;pandoc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A typical run of &lt;code&gt;pandoc&lt;/code&gt; looks like the following:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;pandoc notes.md -o notes.docx&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will run &lt;code&gt;pandoc&lt;/code&gt; on the file &lt;code&gt;notes.md&lt;/code&gt;. The file&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;extension&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;code&gt;.md&lt;/code&gt; is conventionally used for &lt;code&gt;markdown&lt;/code&gt; files) tells &lt;code&gt;pandoc&lt;/code&gt; that it is written in &lt;code&gt;markdown&lt;/code&gt; and that you want Word output.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:c5823fcb8a1263e1354441821c807a9f:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:c5823fcb8a1263e1354441821c807a9f:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now try this (this requires a LaTeX system to be installed):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;pandoc notes.md -o notes.pdf&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Under the hood, this creates a &lt;code&gt;.tex&lt;/code&gt; file and runs LaTeX on it to produce a PDF file with the LaTeX defaults &amp;mdash; probably already better than Word!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rather than retype the commands every time, try pressing the up arrow! It will bring back your previous commands, which you can also edit as required&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;markdown-cheat-sheet:c5823fcb8a1263e1354441821c807a9f&#34;&gt;Markdown cheat sheet&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This gives the main syntax constructs for Markdown as extended by &lt;code&gt;pandoc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-markdown&#34;&gt;# Top-level title #

## Second-level title ##

### Third-level title ###

(you get the picture)

_italics like this_ or *this is also italics*

__bold like this__ or **this is also bold**

A link that leads to [pandoc&#39;s homepage](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc)

* A top-level bullet list
* Another item
    * A sub-item
    * Another sub-item
        * And even deeper nesting

1. A numbered list
2. Another item on the list
1. The actual numbers do not matter
5. So you don&#39;t have to renumber things if you rearrange them

~~This is strikethrough~~ (not really useful perhaps except for some
syntax?)

&amp;gt; If you have long quotations, you can typeset them in blocks like
&amp;gt; this

This will be ~subscript~ and this will be ^superscript^

You can also have footnotes.[^1]

(@ex) This will be a numbered example

You can refer to it in the text by writing (@ex) again --- as long as
the label is unique within the document, the numbering and referencing
will be automatic

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;command-line-options:c5823fcb8a1263e1354441821c807a9f&#34;&gt;Command-line options&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are other options that you can pass to &lt;code&gt;pandoc&lt;/code&gt; that influence what it does&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most options have long and short forms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;em&gt;short&lt;/em&gt; option usually consist of a single hyphen, a single letter and a space followed by an argument&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;pandoc myfile.md -o myfile.pdf&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt; form, there are two hyphens and the argument comes after an equals sign with no spaces&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;pandoc myfile.md --output=myfile.pdf&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These are equivalent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;some-useful-options:c5823fcb8a1263e1354441821c807a9f&#34;&gt;Some useful options&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;-o FILE / --output=FILE&lt;/code&gt;: the name of the file you want to produce. &lt;code&gt;pandoc&lt;/code&gt; tries to guess the output format using the extension. If you do not pass this option, &lt;code&gt;pandoc&lt;/code&gt; will just spit out the result of the conversion back into the terminal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;-t FORMAT / --to=FORMAT&lt;/code&gt;: the output format, such as &lt;code&gt;docx&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;latex&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;html&lt;/code&gt; or even &lt;code&gt;plain&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;-S / --smart&lt;/code&gt; (capitalization matters! This is also a &lt;em&gt;logical&lt;/em&gt; option, meaning there is no argument): typographically correct output

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This means that &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; is a hyphen (used in contexts such as &amp;lsquo;a difficult-to-parse document&amp;rsquo;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;--&lt;/code&gt; is an en dash (used to denote ranges of numbers, such as 2&amp;ndash;4)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;---&lt;/code&gt; is an em dash (the parenthetical dash &amp;mdash; like this)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&#39;&lt;/code&gt; are corrected to curly quotes depending on context&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;...&lt;/code&gt; is corrected to &amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;-s / --standalone&lt;/code&gt;: if you are converting to a format such as LaTeX or HTML, use this option: it will produce a complete file with all the necessary headers and footers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;-V KEY[=VAL] / --variable=KEY:VAL&lt;/code&gt;: this is used for setting variables such as author or font; see examples below

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NB! If you have spaces in the value you&amp;rsquo;re trying to pass, put the whole value in quotes: &lt;code&gt;--V mainfont=&amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;--variable=mainfont:&amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;-M KEY[=VAL] / --metadata=KEY:VAL&lt;/code&gt;: this is used for setting metadata&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;--toc / --table-of-contents&lt;/code&gt;: include a table of contents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;-N / --number-sections&lt;/code&gt;: what it says. By default, sections in LaTeX (and therefore PDF) output are unnumbered, so it makes sense to turn this on. This has no effect in &lt;code&gt;.docx&lt;/code&gt; files, however; you need to fix the &lt;code&gt;.docx&lt;/code&gt; template to achieve that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;--reference-docx=FILE&lt;/code&gt;: you can create a &lt;code&gt;.docx&lt;/code&gt; file with the correct styling (e.g. fonts, sizes, colours) and reuse it by passing in this option. The content of the reference file will be ignored. It is recommended to create a &lt;code&gt;.docx&lt;/code&gt; file using &lt;code&gt;pandoc&lt;/code&gt;, edit its styles to achieve the desired result, and reuse it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;--latex-engine=pdflatex|lualatex|xelatex&lt;/code&gt;: see below&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;nice-fonts-and-ipa-in-pdf-output:c5823fcb8a1263e1354441821c807a9f&#34;&gt;Nice fonts (and IPA) in PDF output&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By default, &lt;code&gt;pandoc&lt;/code&gt; creates PDF output using &lt;code&gt;pdflatex&lt;/code&gt; &amp;mdash; a very stable version of LaTeX that is, however, quite archaic in its handling of fonts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In particular, you might have trouble with the IPA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To overcome this problem, I suggest using &lt;code&gt;--latex-engine=xelatex&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crucially, this also allows you to use any font you have installed on your system rather than Computer Modern (the default font in LaTeX)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To achieve this, you need to pass in a variable in addition to setting the engine: &lt;code&gt;--variable=mainfont:&amp;lt;name of font&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most &amp;lsquo;usual&amp;rsquo; fonts on modern systems (such as Times New Roman or Cambria) support the IPA fine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nice alternatives with IPA support include &lt;a href=&#34;http://junicode.sourceforge.net&#34;&gt;Junicode&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://scholarsfonts.net/cardofnt.html&#34;&gt;Cardo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://scripts.sil.org/gentium&#34;&gt;Gentium&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.brill.com/about/brill-fonts&#34;&gt;Brill&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;more-uses-for-variables:c5823fcb8a1263e1354441821c807a9f&#34;&gt;More uses for variables&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One frequent complaint about non-customized LaTeX output is the large amount of white space on the page compared to the Word defaults&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is actually a good reason for that (shorter lines make the text more readable), but this is easy to fix&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just pass in &lt;code&gt;--variable=geometry:a4paper&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;--metadata&lt;/code&gt; option is very similar to &lt;code&gt;--variable&lt;/code&gt;, and it&amp;rsquo;s used in a similar way&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can use it to set things such author, title, and date&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;--metadata=author:&amp;quot;Pavel Iosad&amp;quot; --metadata=title:&amp;quot;Pandoc notes&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a better way of providing these three essential bits of information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start your &lt;code&gt;markdown&lt;/code&gt; source file with three lines that all start with %&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;% This is the title
% This is the author
% This is the date
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you want to leave one of these out, just leave the line blank after the % sign&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can also put in more complicated metadata in the header: consult the &lt;code&gt;pandoc&lt;/code&gt; manual for that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;bibliography:c5823fcb8a1263e1354441821c807a9f&#34;&gt;Bibliography&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;pandoc&lt;/code&gt; can also do automated tracking of references and citations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This means that you only need to mention the work you intend to refer to in the text using a unique &lt;em&gt;citation key&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;code&gt;pandoc&lt;/code&gt; will take care of putting into your reference list and typesetting the entry in line with the style you require. This process is automatic, so if you end up deleting the in-text citation the entry will also not appear in the reference list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To make this work, you require two components:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A bibliographic database&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A style file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The bibliographic database (which you should have anyway, to save retyping references you end up reusing) can be in BibTeX format

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Such databases can be maintained using bespoke software such as &lt;a href=&#34;http://bibdesk.sourceforge.net&#34;&gt;BibDesk&lt;/a&gt; (installed with MacTeX) or &lt;a href=&#34;http://jabref.sourceforge.net&#34;&gt;JabRef&lt;/a&gt;. Since &lt;code&gt;.bib&lt;/code&gt; files are also plain text files, it is possible to do it using your text editor too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can also keep your database in a program such as &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.zotero.org&#34;&gt;Zotero&lt;/a&gt; and export it to &lt;code&gt;.bib&lt;/code&gt; when you update it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can use other formats with &lt;code&gt;pandoc&lt;/code&gt;, but BibTeX is the most portable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-database:c5823fcb8a1263e1354441821c807a9f&#34;&gt;The database&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An entry in a BibTeX database looks something like this:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;@Book{kiparsky82:_explan,
  author = 	 {Kiparsky, Paul},
  title = 	 {Explanation in phonology},
  publisher = 	 {Foris},
  year = 	 1982,
  location = 	 {Dordrecht}}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Or, in a graphical program (here: Bibdesk)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://anghyflawn.github.io/images/kiparsky.png&#34; alt=&#34;Example BibTeX entry&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fields are largely self-explanatory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The most important one is the &lt;em&gt;citation key&lt;/em&gt;: the mnemonic name you use to refer to the entry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is the bit after the opening &lt;code&gt;{&lt;/code&gt; in the source and &amp;lsquo;cite key&amp;rsquo; in the window&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(It doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be this descriptive, e.g. you can use &lt;code&gt;SPE&lt;/code&gt; for Chomsky &amp;amp; Halle 1967&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You use the cite key to refer to the work

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;[@kiparsky82:_explan]&lt;/code&gt; $\Rightarrow$ (Kiparsky 1982)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;[@kiparsky82:_explan, p. 1]&lt;/code&gt; $\Rightarrow$ (Kiparsky 1982, p. 1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;@kiparsky82:_explan shows&lt;/code&gt; $\Rightarrow$ Kiparsky (1982) shows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;@kiparsky82:_explan [p. 1] shows&lt;/code&gt; $\Rightarrow$ Kiparsky (1982, p. 1) shows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Phonology has some explaining to do [as shown by @kiparsky82:_explan]&lt;/code&gt; $\Rightarrow$ Phonology has some explaining to do (as shown by Kiparsky 1982)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;One of Kiparsky&#39;s important works [-@kiparsky82:_explan]&lt;/code&gt; $\Rightarrow$ One of Kiparsky&amp;rsquo;s important works (1982)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can also have multiple citations, separated by a semicolon

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;[@spe; @kiparsky82:_explan]&lt;/code&gt; $\Rightarrow$ (Chomsky &amp;amp; Halle 1967; Kiparsky 1982)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-style:c5823fcb8a1263e1354441821c807a9f&#34;&gt;The style&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In output formats other than LaTeX, &lt;code&gt;pandoc&lt;/code&gt; uses the &lt;code&gt;.csl&lt;/code&gt; format to describe citation styles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CSL files are available in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.zotero.org/styles&#34;&gt;Zotero style repository&lt;/a&gt; for the Unified Style Sheet for Linguistics Journals (one of the recommended styles for LEL), APA, and many others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setting up automated bibliographies with LaTeX output requires a bit of fiddling about with LaTeX\ itself: shoot me an email if you need help with that&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;putting-it-all-together:c5823fcb8a1263e1354441821c807a9f&#34;&gt;Putting it all together&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This will create a &lt;code&gt;.docx&lt;/code&gt; file with a bibliography styled using the Unified Style Sheet:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;pandoc myfile.md -o myfile.docx --bibliography=path/to/your/bib/file
--csl=path/to/your/csl/file&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When creating a bibliography in a Word file, remember to end the file with a header at the appropriate level saying something like &lt;code&gt;# References #&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;going-further:c5823fcb8a1263e1354441821c807a9f&#34;&gt;Going further&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;getting-help:c5823fcb8a1263e1354441821c807a9f&#34;&gt;Getting help&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html&#34;&gt;pandoc manual&lt;/a&gt; is excellent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;more-things-to-do:c5823fcb8a1263e1354441821c807a9f&#34;&gt;More things to do?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re willing to get your hands (a bit) dirty with TeX, you can fiddle around with templates and set up bibliographies in LaTeX output&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you do any work with R, you&amp;rsquo;ll know about &lt;code&gt;knitr&lt;/code&gt;, the R library for reproducible research. By default (as set up in RStudio), &lt;code&gt;knitr&lt;/code&gt; outputs HTML files, but it can also be set up to generate other formats via &lt;code&gt;pandoc&lt;/code&gt; (see &lt;a href=&#34;http://yihui.name/knitr/demo/pandoc/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To avoid repetitive typing / command history scouring, consider scripting or Emacs / Vim with their &lt;code&gt;pandoc&lt;/code&gt; utilities (both are also excellent LaTeX editors if you go down that particular rabbit hole)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider using version control systems such as Git; see &lt;a href=&#34;http://datapub.cdlib.org/2014/05/05/github-a-primer-for-researchers/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:c5823fcb8a1263e1354441821c807a9f:1&#34;&gt;Again, the precise number does not matter, as long as it&amp;rsquo;s the same in the references and the note itself. You can intersperse the footnotes with the text or put them all the end, they will come out as footnotes anyway.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:c5823fcb8a1263e1354441821c807a9f:1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[return]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

<title>Humidity causes complex tones?</title>
<link>http://anghyflawn.github.io/blog/2015/humidity-causes-complex-tones/</link>
<pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
<guid>http://anghyflawn.github.io/blog/2015/humidity-causes-complex-tones/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.koensebregts.nl&#34;&gt;Koen Sebregts&lt;/a&gt;  points out that the title of my post is misleading, since the authors explicitly state they do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; predict humidity to cause complex tones. I&amp;rsquo;ll leave it unchanged as a warning to myself.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a new &amp;lsquo;geophonetics&amp;rsquo; paper out at PNAS this morning &lt;a href=&#34;http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1417413112&#34;&gt;Climate, vocal folds, and tonal languages: Connecting the physiological and geographic dots&lt;/a&gt; by Caleb Everett, Damián Blasi, and Seán Roberts. In a nutshell, the claim, as I understand it, is that since low humidity is inimical to precise manipulation of vocal folds, languages with &amp;lsquo;complex tone&amp;rsquo; (understood as having a more than two-way pitch-based contrast) are unlikely to thrive in regions with low humidity (i.e. hot and arid, and all types of cold). This hypothesis appears to explain the areal patterns in the prevalence of tone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The phonetic component of the argument seems quite sound to me, and I&amp;rsquo;m not really qualified to judge the evolutionary part of this paper in any reasonable way. As a phonologist, there&amp;rsquo;s something that really bothers me though, and that is the almost total lack of critical discussion of what it means to be a tonal language. It&amp;rsquo;s noticeable that the phonological part of the bibliography is really sparse, especially compared to the phonetic part: there&amp;rsquo;s Moira Yip&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Tone&lt;/em&gt; textbook, several large-scale overviews like Maddieson (1978) and Hyman (2001), a couple of tonogenesis citations, and Jonathan Kaye&amp;rsquo;s (1990) textbook cited as an example of the consensus as disputed by the authors. No other work by Larry Hyman, who has published a lot on the typology of &amp;lsquo;tone languages&amp;rsquo;, no discussion of the whole idea of &amp;lsquo;pitch accent&amp;rsquo; and how it relates to tone: the only definition given (p. 2) is &amp;lsquo;phonemic tone, in which pitch is used to contrast lexical meaning&amp;rsquo;. The data sources are &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wals.info&#34;&gt;WALS&lt;/a&gt; and especially the &lt;a href=&#34;http://phonotactics.anu.edu.au/&#34;&gt;ANU phonotactics database&lt;/a&gt;. Both of these sources, while extremely valuable, put a lot of emphasis on documenting &amp;lsquo;diversity&amp;rsquo; and quite a bit less on pinpointing what exactly it is they&amp;rsquo;re talking about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve gone to the ANU database to have a look at what it says about tone in languages I know about. Now I work on fairly &amp;lsquo;boring&amp;rsquo;, European languages, but recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been getting quite interested in the European &amp;lsquo;pitch accent&amp;rsquo; systems, plus I actually know a bit about these languages, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d have a go at a selection. I have to say I wasn&amp;rsquo;t exactly happy with the results. The following list gives the number of tonal contrasts given for that language in the ANU database, and my comments if any.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Celtic

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scots Gaelic: 0. This can&amp;rsquo;t be right; there is a &amp;lsquo;pitch accent&amp;rsquo; or glottalization system in most varieties as far as we know. As a shameless plug, &lt;a href=&#34;http://anghyflawn.github.io/pdf/icngl.paper.pdf&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; is a paper of mine with more references inside.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Welsh: 0. (The pitch system of Welsh is non-trivial, but fair enough.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cornish: 0. (Probably, but how do we know for sure?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manx: 0. (Probably true, but how did it end up somewhere in the Trossachs?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Breton: 0. (Fair enough, although see the paper linked above for some discussion.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;North Germanic

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Danish: 0. Here&amp;rsquo;s a good example of the controversy. Danish has stød, a type of laryngealization. Does it count? Maybe not, but it has been analysed as being tonal (e.g. by Junko Itô &amp;amp; Armin Mester and Tomas Riad), although &lt;a href=&#34;http://dx.doi.org/10.1159/000354640&#34;&gt;reasonable people disagree&lt;/a&gt;. In any case, tonal dialects of Danish &lt;a href=&#34;http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03740463.1990.10411522&#34;&gt;definitely exist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;lsquo;Jysk&amp;rsquo;: 0. (Why not Jutland Danish or the like? Anyway, it has both regular stød and so-called Western Jutland stød, how do we count?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Old Norse: 0. We don&amp;rsquo;t know that! Not zero according to &lt;a href=&#34;http://dx.doi.org/10.1075/dia.15.1.04ria&#34;&gt;Tomas Riad&lt;/a&gt;, anyway. Or see &lt;a href=&#34;http://uni.hi.is/haukurth/doktorsverkefni/&#34;&gt;Haukur Þorgeirsson&amp;rsquo;s dissertation&lt;/a&gt; – OK, it&amp;rsquo;s in Icelandic, but still&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nynorsk: 2. Nynorsk is a written standard&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aurland: 2. Why Aurland specifically? But fair enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trondheim: 2. Does this mean Standard Norwegian as spoken in Trondheim? Well then yes. But all around Trondheim you have dialects with so-called &amp;lsquo;circumflex accent&amp;rsquo;, where apocope creates a tonal contrast in monosyllables (usually absent in North Germanic). Does it count as 2 (after all, there is only ever a two-way contrast in monosyllables vs polysyllables) or 3 (the traditional way of looking at things)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;West Germanic

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limburgish [sic]: 2. OK, so we count pitch accents as tones. But many people have argued that it&amp;rsquo;s not a &lt;em&gt;lexical tone&lt;/em&gt; contrast but instead something else. How do we count? (Actually, the same question applies to much of North Germanic.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kölsch: 0. Unless I&amp;rsquo;m grossly mistaken, it does have a similar type of &amp;lsquo;tonal accent&amp;rsquo; system to Limburg. So either both have tones or neither.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Baltic

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Latvian: 2. That&amp;rsquo;s just incorrect, I think – at least in conservative varieties you have a three-way contrast in stressed syllables. OK, the third &amp;lsquo;accent&amp;rsquo; involves glottalization as well, but how do we decide to exclude that?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lithuanian: 0. Definitely has a pitch accent system. If Latvian is treated as having two contrasts then surely Lithuanian should have (at least) two?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slavic

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Serbian: 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Croatian: 0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chakavian [sic]: 3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bosnian: 0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To me, this doesn&amp;rsquo;t really compute: there are certainly differences among these varieties but as far as I know they&amp;rsquo;re not quite as drastic. (That is off the top of my head, though, I&amp;rsquo;m willing to be corrected.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also note that Basque has 0 contrasts, while Japanese has 2 or 3; there are dialects of Basque that have been argued to have a similar pitch accent system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of this is to say that the ANU database is bad and unusable, or that the paper is incorrect rubbish. This is a random, small selection of unrelated languages in a particular region. There is also much to be said for treating European tonal accents as a typologically unusual special case – Jakobson did that with Baltic tonal &lt;em&gt;Sprachbund&lt;/em&gt; in 1931 already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the authors are clear that their predictions should be particularly salient in relatively extreme environmental conditions, so it&amp;rsquo;s not entirely beside the point to look at northern Europe more closely. And it&amp;rsquo;s interesting that in the survey above the ANU database is consistently underreporting the number of tonal contrasts in this fairly cold, fairly dry region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This does worry me. I&amp;rsquo;m sure the statistical models give the correct results for the data that&amp;rsquo;s fed into them. I&amp;rsquo;m willing to accept that the large amount of data might drown out this sort of noise. And yet, still, I&amp;rsquo;m finding it difficult to be convinced in matters I know little about when the things that I do know something about are a bit dodgy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, this isn&amp;rsquo;t about bashing the munging of large-scale data. This paper is certainly quite explicit in its hypotheses and proposes a causal explanation based on more than correlations alone. But the data appears to have been collected without much regard to the theoretical underpinnings of what it is that we&amp;rsquo;re actually collecting here. And that means I&amp;rsquo;m not sure.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>‘Pitch accent’ and prosodic structure in Scottish Gaelic</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper considers the origin of &amp;lsquo;pitch accents&amp;rsquo; in Scottish Gaelic
with a view to evaluating the hypothesis that this feature was
borrowed from North Germanic varieties spoken by Norse settlers in
medieval Scotland. It is shown that the &amp;lsquo;pitch accent&amp;rsquo; system in
Gaelic is tightly bound with metrical structure (more precisely
syllable count), certainly diachronically, and probably (at least in
some varieties) synchronically. Gaelic &amp;lsquo;pitch accent&amp;rsquo; is argued to be
a plausible internal development, parallel to similar phenomena in
other branches of Celtic (specifically in Breton), as well as in
Germanic. This conclusion may appear to undermine the contact
hypothesis, especially in the absence of reliable written sources;
nevertheless, a certain role for Norse-Gaelic contact in the
appearance of the pitch accent system cannot be completely excluded&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Historical Phonology</title>
<link>http://anghyflawn.github.io/teaching/2015/historical-phonology/</link>
<pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
<guid>http://anghyflawn.github.io/teaching/2015/historical-phonology/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In this course (co-taught with my colleagues &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/homes/patrick&#34;&gt;Patrick Honeybone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/people/michael-ramsammy&#34;&gt;Michael Ramsammy&lt;/a&gt;) we consider a variety of issues connected to phonological change. Throughout the course, we address questions such as the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do we reconstruct the phonology of past language states?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What types of phonological changes are attested?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can synchronic phonological theory assist us in the study of historical phonology?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What can we learn about the human language faculty by studying historical phonology?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;sup&gt;2014&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2015&lt;/sub&gt;, I cover the following topics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phonological typology and historical phonology (with a focus on consonants)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lenition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Historical phonology and phonological representations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;This course is part of the pre-Honours sequence in all LEL single Honours degrees, as well as of some joint degrees (in addition to being available as an outside course). Its main aim is to familiarize students with the study of linguistic diversity and the relationship between language typology and theory-building. In &lt;sup&gt;2014&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2015&lt;/sub&gt;, I am responsible for the entire phonology block. We cover the following topics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phonological typology and theory. Universals in phonology; descriptive and analytic universals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Universals of inventory organization; feature theory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Syllable structure. Typology of syllable structures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optimality Theory and its application to syllable structure typology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Government Phonology; restrictiveness in theory-building&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stress; metrical typology; metrical typology in OT&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tone and its typology; austosegmental phonology.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

<title>Teaching slides with pandoc and reveal.js</title>
<link>http://anghyflawn.github.io/blog/2014/teaching-slides-with-pandoc-and-reveal-js/</link>
<pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
<guid>http://anghyflawn.github.io/blog/2014/teaching-slides-with-pandoc-and-reveal-js/</guid>
<description>

&lt;p&gt;This past semester I taught a new course entitled &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/14-15/dpt/cxlasc10088.htm&#34;&gt;Phonological Theory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Apart from the content, I decided to experiment a bit with the technical details, specifically using &lt;a href=&#34;http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc&#34;&gt;pandoc&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;reveal.js&#34;&gt;reveal.js&lt;/a&gt; to do the slides and lecture notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a pretty consistent LaTeX user, so to the extent I do slides I do them in &lt;code&gt;beamer&lt;/code&gt;. There is nothing inherently problematic with this, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/&#34;&gt;AUCTeX&lt;/a&gt; saves typing a lot of the boilerplate, but writing two–three presentations per week is still time-consuming. I also tend to do the non-recommended thing and put a lot of text on my slides; my justification (apart from the fact that it lets me pace the lectures at least the first time around) is that I use &lt;code&gt;beamerarticle&lt;/code&gt; to produce a more text-like notes document that is then quite detailed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why pandoc? Well, partly just for the fun of it. My slides + notes workflow also fits quite well with its philosophy of producing multiple output formats from a single input. Perhaps most importantly, markdown is obviously less &amp;lsquo;noisy&amp;rsquo; than LaTeX. Compare this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-markdown&#34;&gt;## Slide title ##

* Item 1
* Item 2
    * Subitem 1
    * Subitem 2
* Item 3
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-latex&#34;&gt;\begin{frame}{Slide title}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Item 1
  \item Item 2
  \begin{itemize}
      \item Subitem 1
      \item Subitem 2
  \end{itemize}
  \item Item 3
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you&amp;rsquo;re pretty proficient in LaTeX and filter out the visual noise, I think it&amp;rsquo;s pretty obvious that the former is a bit less horrible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I&amp;rsquo;ve now taught the entire course using this workflow, and overall I think I was quite happy with it. The workflow carries over nicely and although there were things that took a bit more work than they would have done if I were using LaTeX I think I felt at least as productive when using pandoc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-good:b7cb6333f64fce53cd91cff316b43a20&#34;&gt;The good&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing markdown is of course a piece of cake. I&amp;rsquo;m using Emacs with &lt;a href=&#34;http://jblevins.org/projects/markdown-mode/&#34;&gt;markdown-mode&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://joostkremers.github.io/pandoc-mode/&#34;&gt;pandoc-mode&lt;/a&gt;, which makes it even easier. Consider the task of indenting a sublist, e.g. making a list item (and all its subitems) into a subitem of something else. In markdown-mode, it&amp;rsquo;s a matter of a single keystroke, while in LaTeX it&amp;rsquo;d involve a whole new environment and possibly other adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The text would usually carry over from slides to notes quite painlessly, so that&amp;rsquo;s good. Pandoc-mode also has a handy feature called a &lt;em&gt;project settings file&lt;/em&gt; which allows you to reuse pandoc settings (e.g. includes, bibliography files, CSL files etc.) across multiple input files – having chosen a single set of options it&amp;rsquo;s easy to use them for all the &lt;code&gt;.md&lt;/code&gt; files in that directory. If, for whatever reason, you need to use a different set of options for an individual document, that&amp;rsquo;s also possible with per-file settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pandoc also gives you a lot of latitude to tweak how the output looks like, since you have full access to the templates it uses to build the output. This means that my lecture notes look pretty much like any other documents I write and don&amp;rsquo;t use the default TeX settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really liked Reveal.js. It looks pretty nice (though see below) and it has some nifty features. Some are perhaps more pretty than really useful, but I though the overview mode and the speaker notes were especially handy (the speaker notes in particular are nice when you don&amp;rsquo;t want to put something on the slide but still have it in the notes).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-less-good-and-some-tips:b7cb6333f64fce53cd91cff316b43a20&#34;&gt;The less good, and some tips&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did run into some issues that needed resolving, although partly they involve just shaking off the LaTeX mentality. An obvious issue is the lack of access to LaTeX macros. Pandoc has support for a subset of TeX maths in non-TeX output, so it is possible to use things like &lt;code&gt;$\rightarrow$&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;$\emptyset$&lt;/code&gt; (which you need a lot in a course like that), but getting a feature matrix (for which you&amp;rsquo;d use some version of &lt;code&gt;array&lt;/code&gt;) is more difficult. Still, it&amp;rsquo;s not as crippling as Word, so that&amp;rsquo;s an advantage already. I didn&amp;rsquo;t really run into a case where there was no way to write what I wanted to write, but I did end up typing out &lt;code&gt;$\rightarrow$&lt;/code&gt; a bit more often than I would have wished. (I should probably just have assigned some keystrokes to the right symbols, but I never got round to it.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Pandoc-mode does come with something called &lt;code&gt;@@&lt;/code&gt;-directives, which can be kicked into a shape resembling TeX macros, but they&amp;rsquo;re still pretty limited and also require more Elisp skills than I could dust off while writing a new course from scratch.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diagrams and drawings are another potentially problematic issue. Thankfully, pandoc comes with the filter facility, and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jgm/pandocfilters/&#34;&gt;example repository&lt;/a&gt; contains a filter that takes TikZ code and feeds it straight into the output when the output is TeX but creates an image file and embeds it if the output is something else. With a little bit of hacking I was able to make it understand environments like &lt;code&gt;forest&lt;/code&gt; (which I recommend for drawing trees) and generally have the pictures assume the desired look and feel. So that&amp;rsquo;s doable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One potential issue that it took me some time to figure out was getting speaker notes to play nicely. Reveal.js presentations can be shown as static files, but then you don&amp;rsquo;t have access to speaker notes. To get the notes, you need to run a local server using some Node.js magic or other. For one thing, this obviously means that you need to lug your laptop around to the lecture and hope it works. More importantly, reveal.js seems to assume your presentation resides in the same folder as the reveal.js files. If you have multiple source and output files in the directory for your course, you probably don&amp;rsquo;t want to clutter it with its js, css and so on, but rather keep it in a separate folder. But this means that when you run &lt;code&gt;grunt serve&lt;/code&gt; from the reveal.js folder, you don&amp;rsquo;t get access to your files. To fix that, you need to go open &lt;code&gt;Gruntfile.js&lt;/code&gt; and find the lines&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-js&#34;&gt;		connect: {
			server: {
				options: {
					port: port,
					base: &#39;.&#39;
				}
			}
		},
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Change the &lt;code&gt;base&lt;/code&gt; option to &lt;code&gt;&#39;../&#39;&lt;/code&gt;, and it will serve files from the directory above reveal.js, which is what you probably want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One feature that I miss in reveal.js is a counterpart to &lt;code&gt;beamer&lt;/code&gt;&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;allowframebreaks&lt;/code&gt; option. It does support manual slide breaking, but that is obviously fragile (not least because the screen in the lecture room doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily have the same proportions as yours, so you don&amp;rsquo;t have a 100% reliable guide to when the slide is overfull). Of course you don&amp;rsquo;t have this problem if you don&amp;rsquo;t put too much text on your slide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final thing that is not so much a problem as a consequence of lack of time for my part is that changing the look and feel of reveal.js beyond the stock themes requires passable CSS skills, and I definitely did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; have time for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion:b7cb6333f64fce53cd91cff316b43a20&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found the pandoc + reveal.js route to be a good alternative to beamer for teaching. I think I&amp;rsquo;ll stick to LaTeX/&lt;code&gt;beamer&lt;/code&gt; rather than pandoc for serious paper-writing, since the loss of the LaTeX power is only partially compensated by the relative ease of markdown, but for teaching I would recommend this alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One potential issue that it took me some time to figure out was getting speaker notes to play nicely. Reveal.js presentations can be shown as static files, but then you don&amp;rsquo;t have access to speaker notes. To get the notes, you need to run a local server using some Node.js magic or other. For one thing, this obviously means that you need to lug your laptop around to the lecture and hope it works. More importantly, reveal.js seems to assume your presentation resides in the same folder as the reveal.js files. If you have multiple source and output files in the directory for your course, you probably don&amp;rsquo;t want to clutter it with its js, css and so on, but rather keep it in a separate folder. But this means that when you run &lt;code&gt;grunt serve&lt;/code&gt; from the reveal.js folder, you don&amp;rsquo;t get access to your files. To fix that, you need to go open &lt;code&gt;Gruntfile.js&lt;/code&gt; and find the lines&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-js&#34;&gt;		connect: {
			server: {
				options: {
					port: port,
					base: &#39;.&#39;
				}
			}
		},
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Change the &lt;code&gt;base&lt;/code&gt; option to &lt;code&gt;&#39;../&#39;&lt;/code&gt;, and it will serve files from the directory above reveal.js, which is what you probably want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One feature that I miss in reveal.js is a counterpart to &lt;code&gt;beamer&lt;/code&gt;&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;allowframebreaks&lt;/code&gt; option. It does support manual slide breaking, but that is obviously fragile (not least because the screen in the lecture room doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily have the same proportions as yours, so you don&amp;rsquo;t have a 100% reliable guide to when the slide is overfull). Of course you don&amp;rsquo;t have this problem if you don&amp;rsquo;t put too much text on your slide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final thing that is not so much a problem as a consequence of lack of time for my part is that changing the look and feel of reveal.js beyond the stock themes requires passable CSS skills, and I definitely did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; have time for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion:b7cb6333f64fce53cd91cff316b43a20&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found the pandoc + reveal.js route to be a good alternative to beamer for teaching. I think I&amp;rsquo;ll stick to LaTeX/&lt;code&gt;beamer&lt;/code&gt; rather than pandoc for serious paper-writing, since the loss of the LaTeX power is only partially compensated by the relative ease of markdown, but for teaching I would recommend this alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Getting ESS and AUCTeX to play nicely with knitr</title>
<link>http://anghyflawn.github.io/blog/2014/getting-ess-and-auctex-to-play-nicely-with-knitr/</link>
<pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
<guid>http://anghyflawn.github.io/blog/2014/getting-ess-and-auctex-to-play-nicely-with-knitr/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Although my job title is &amp;lsquo;Lecturer in Theoretical Phonology&amp;rsquo; (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/pavel-iosad(976edf38-f950-4179-a032-a6cea4b31b3b.html&#34;&gt;no, really&lt;/a&gt;), I&amp;rsquo;ve been getting into more empirical work. I went on a data collection trip to South Wales in February to work with Welsh, and only early this week we had two great days collecting Gaelic data in North Argyll – not an area &lt;em&gt;readily&lt;/em&gt; associated with Gaelic these days, but in fact we found quite a few very good speakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this post isn&amp;rsquo;t about that. Having collected the data and processed some of it, I have also been getting to grips with &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; doing statistical analysis (as opposed to working through textbooks), which these days inevitably means &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.r-project.org.&#34;&gt;R&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m giving a couple of talks in Wales next week (&lt;a href=&#34;http://privatewww.essex.ac.uk/~wss/wss-21.htm&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://amrywiaeth.wordpress.com&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) with some of the results, so the time had come for me to think about getting my data into my presentations (and eventually papers). Being a LaTeX user, after some poking about I settled on &lt;a href=&#34;http://yihui.name/knitr&#34;&gt;knitr&lt;/a&gt; as the way to get stuff out of R and into LaTeX.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the R wizards I know use &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rstudio.com&#34;&gt;RStudio&lt;/a&gt;, which is a very good IDE for R, but doesn&amp;rsquo;t come close to the power of Emacs with AUCTeX for LaTeX writing. So far I have found &lt;a href=&#34;http://ess.r-studio.org&#34;&gt;ESS&lt;/a&gt; to be perfectly adequare for my R needs. ESS also supports knitting &lt;code&gt;.Rnw&lt;/code&gt; files out of the box via &lt;code&gt;M-n r&lt;/code&gt;. Its default weaving engine, however, is Sweave. After some poking about, here&amp;rsquo;s how to get ESS and AUCTeX to play nicely with knitr.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two components. One is to make knitr the default engine when tangling outside AUCTeX. This is easily achieved via &lt;code&gt;(setq ess-swv-processor &#39;knitr)&lt;/code&gt; in your &lt;code&gt;init.el&lt;/code&gt;, but this only allows you to use knitr as the default when you tangle via &lt;code&gt;M-n T&lt;/code&gt;. What this doesn&amp;rsquo;t automate is running LaTeX on the product of the knitting: you have to switch to the &lt;code&gt;.tex&lt;/code&gt; file manually and run stuff from there, but this runs the risk of making edits to the &lt;code&gt;.tex&lt;/code&gt; file instead of the &lt;code&gt;.Rnw&lt;/code&gt;. ESS also has a &lt;code&gt;latex&lt;/code&gt; tangling option (&lt;code&gt;M-n l&lt;/code&gt;), but this just runs &lt;code&gt;latex&lt;/code&gt; from the shell, without any of the AUCTeX customizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ESS also has the option to plug into AUCTeX, making relevant commands available to the user via &lt;code&gt;C-c C-c&lt;/code&gt;. This is much handier, but unfortunately the functions which add these commands are hardcoded to use Sweave from the shell rather than &lt;code&gt;ess-swv-run-in-R&lt;/code&gt;, which is sensitive to the value of &lt;code&gt;ess-swv-processor&lt;/code&gt;. So here&amp;rsquo;s what you need in order to get knitr to run into AUCTeX.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-elisp&#34;&gt;;; somewhere after (require &#39;ess-site)
(setq ess-swv-plug-into-AUCTeX-p t)

(defun ess-swv-add-TeX-commands ()
  &amp;quot;Add commands to AUCTeX&#39;s \\[TeX-command-list].&amp;quot;
  (unless (and (featurep &#39;tex-site) (featurep &#39;tex))
    (error &amp;quot;AUCTeX does not seem to be loaded&amp;quot;))
  (add-to-list &#39;TeX-command-list
               &#39;(&amp;quot;Knit&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Rscript -e \&amp;quot;library(knitr); knit(&#39;%t&#39;)\&amp;quot;&amp;quot;
                 TeX-run-command nil (latex-mode) :help
                 &amp;quot;Run Knitr&amp;quot;) t)
  (add-to-list &#39;TeX-command-list
               &#39;(&amp;quot;LaTeXKnit&amp;quot; &amp;quot;%l %(mode) %s&amp;quot;
                 TeX-run-TeX nil (latex-mode) :help
                 &amp;quot;Run LaTeX after Knit&amp;quot;) t)
  (setq TeX-command-default &amp;quot;Knit&amp;quot;)
  (mapc (lambda (suffix)
          (add-to-list &#39;TeX-file-extensions suffix))
        &#39;(&amp;quot;nw&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Snw&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Rnw&amp;quot;)))

(defun ess-swv-remove-TeX-commands (x)
  &amp;quot;Helper function: check if car of X is one of the Knitr strings&amp;quot;
  (let ((swv-cmds &#39;(&amp;quot;Knit&amp;quot; &amp;quot;LaTeXKnit&amp;quot;)))
    (unless (member (car x) swv-cmds) x)))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are just little changes to the original functions defined in &lt;code&gt;ess-swv.el&lt;/code&gt;. Now you can, via &lt;code&gt;C-c C-c&lt;/code&gt;, access &lt;code&gt;Knit&lt;/code&gt; (which just produces the &lt;code&gt;.tex&lt;/code&gt; file) and &lt;code&gt;LaTeXKnit&lt;/code&gt;, which runs the LaTeX process as customized by AUCTeX (e.g. to use XeTeX or whatever other options you normally use) on the output, without you having to go the &lt;code&gt;.tex&lt;/code&gt; file. Which is nice.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The phonology and morphosyntax of Breton mutation</title>
<link>http://anghyflawn.github.io/writing/breton-mutation/</link>
<pubDate>Sun, 01 Jun 2014 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
<guid>http://anghyflawn.github.io/writing/breton-mutation/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I analyse of initial consonant mutation in a Breton dialect, with a
focus on establishing the division of labour between phonology and
morphology in the triggering of mutation and its phonological
expression. I argue that different types of mutation have different
status in the grammar: some are purely phonological, others involve
subsegmental morphemes with a clear morphosyntactic rationale, and for
some the phonological aspects are clear but the morphosyntactic
motivation remains obscure. In addition, the differences among the
types of mutation support a stratal model of morphology-phonology
interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Emacs: give a DOI, get a BibTeX entry</title>
<link>http://anghyflawn.github.io/blog/2014/emacs-give-a-doi-get-a-bibtex-entry/</link>
<pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
<guid>http://anghyflawn.github.io/blog/2014/emacs-give-a-doi-get-a-bibtex-entry/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;One of my enduring frustrations with the various academic publishing platforms (CJO, ScienceDirect, JSTOR and their ilk) is the wildly inconsistent way in which they export BibTeX entries for articles. Sometimes they put them right on the browser page for easy copy-and-paste; sometimes it comes up after a few clicks in a new window; sometimes you end up downloading a file with an impossibly long or counterintuitive name, or called something like &lt;code&gt;science.bib&lt;/code&gt; (which Chrome tends to turn into &lt;code&gt;science (14).bib&lt;/code&gt; as they accumulate). Since I really only need the BibTeX entry once to get into my master &lt;code&gt;.bib&lt;/code&gt; file, that is a waste of time and resources. So if you&amp;rsquo;re using Emacs, here&amp;rsquo;s a simple function which might be helpful&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-elisp&#34;&gt;(defun get-bibtex-from-doi (doi)
 &amp;quot;Get a BibTeX entry from the DOI&amp;quot;
 (interactive &amp;quot;MDOI: &amp;quot;)
 (let ((url-mime-accept-string &amp;quot;text/bibliography;style=bibtex&amp;quot;))
   (with-current-buffer 
     (url-retrieve-synchronously 
       (format &amp;quot;http://dx.doi.org/%s&amp;quot; 
       	(replace-regexp-in-string &amp;quot;http://dx.doi.org/&amp;quot; &amp;quot;&amp;quot; doi)))
     (switch-to-buffer (current-buffer))
     (goto-char (point-max))
     (setq bibtex-entry 
     	  (buffer-substring 
          	(string-match &amp;quot;@&amp;quot; (buffer-string))
              (point)))
     (kill-buffer (current-buffer))))
 (insert (decode-coding-string bibtex-entry &#39;utf-8))
 (bibtex-fill-entry))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will ask you for the DOI (you can keep the &lt;code&gt;http://dx.doi.org/&lt;/code&gt; bit that you get if you do &amp;lsquo;Copy Link Address&amp;rsquo; from the browser), pull the BibTeX entry via the DOI API, and insert it at point. (I&amp;rsquo;m assuming the buffer is in &lt;code&gt;bibtex-mode&lt;/code&gt; already, since it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really make sense for it not to be.) Put this in your &lt;code&gt;init.el&lt;/code&gt; and you can now do &lt;code&gt;M-x get-bibtex-from-doi&lt;/code&gt;, or bind it to a keychord of your choice. The entry might still need fiddling with (e.g. to fix the citekey in line with your scheme, or to remove the Unicode characters if need be), but hopefully this might be useful.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A nynorsk for Scotland?</title>
<link>http://anghyflawn.github.io/blog/2014/a-nynorsk-for-scotland/</link>
<pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>

<description>

&lt;p&gt;With the Scottish independence debate we hear a lot about the Scandinavian connections and (dis)similarities. I do have my opinions on many of those despite being completely unqualified, but here&amp;rsquo;s one thing that strikes me and that I do know something about: how many people (apart from &lt;a href=&#34;http://catalogue.lib.ed.ac.uk/vwebv/holdingsInfo?searchId=3299&amp;amp;recCount=10&amp;amp;recPointer=1&amp;amp;bibId=1691570&#34;&gt;Guy Puzey&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forskning.no/blog/vangsnes/373842&#34;&gt;Øystein Vangsnes&lt;/a&gt;) have commented on the parallels between Norway and Scotland with regard to their linguistic landscape?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;norway:31d33451f05163bc8e46696038836205&#34;&gt;Norway&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The official position is that there are two written forms of the (single) Norwegian language, &lt;em&gt;bokmål&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;nynorsk&lt;/em&gt;. Historically, bokmål descends from the so-called &lt;em&gt;dannet dagligtale&lt;/em&gt;, the &amp;lsquo;educated vernacular&amp;rsquo;, essentially a Norwegianized (more so in pronunciation, perhaps less in other aspects) version of Danish spoken in the bigger urban areas of Norway. Nynorsk is a written standard created by the linguist Ivar Aasen, consciously based on traditional regional dialects (mostly of Western Norway) and thus opposed to the more Danish-influenced speech of the urban middle and upper classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Landsmål (as Ivar Aasen&amp;rsquo;s language was originally called) was very much a child of its time, when being &amp;lsquo;authentically Norwegian&amp;rsquo; conferred an important legitimacy. The framing of bokmål as &amp;lsquo;Danish&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;alien&amp;rsquo; (and nynorsk as &amp;lsquo;boorish&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;hick&amp;rsquo; – &lt;em&gt;bondsk&lt;/em&gt;, or, as the Irish put it, &lt;em&gt;culchie&lt;/em&gt;) survives, to a certain extent, even to this day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, nynorsk enjoys equal rights with bokmål in law, but it is increasingly being confined to its strongholds in rural parts of Western Norway (where it is has traditionally been the written language given its proximity to the local dialects) and to scattered pockets of people who value it as an expression of Norwegian identity (or of their local identity once they move to the bokmål-dominated city). For many others, it is a dead language, hated as a school subject, a waste of public money and a laughable relic of the past; a veritable curiosity cabinet of these attitudes is presented by Øystein Vangsnes (full disclosure: a former colleague of mine) in his recent &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.samlaget.no/nn-no/fakta%20og%20dokumentar/spraak/spraakleg-toleranse-i-noreg-norge-for-faen/hefta.aspx&#34;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is not the whole story, however. Norway is also host to several other indigenous minority languages, and nynorsk, with its hundreds of thousands of active users (and fairly robust intergenerational transmission, if we can speak of such a thing for a written norm) is in ruddy health compared to some of those. The biggest is Northern Sámi (about 20,000 speakers, not all of them in Norway), with Lule Sámi (not more than 2,000 speakers, most of them in Sweden) and South Sámi (speakers numbering in the hundreds and also split between Norway and Sweden) in addition to Kven (a few thousand speakers); all are spoken as community languages in Northern Norway, a large, sparsely populated, remote region. Although mainstream Norwegian culture is happy for the Sámi to exist and attract tourists with their colourful costume and fluffy reindeer, attempts to make the Sámi language more visible are met at best with indifference (in the south of the country, where people honestly don&amp;rsquo;t understand what the big deal is) and at worst with aggression, whether in Kåfjord / Gáivuotna (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dagbladet.no/kultur/2001/02/06/240324.html&#34;&gt;bilingual signs shot at&lt;/a&gt;), Bodø / Bådåddjo (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.an.no/nyheter/article6055007.ece&#34;&gt;signs repeatedly vandalized&lt;/a&gt;) or Tromsø / Romsa (no signs actually went up after a soberingly aggressive discussion).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;scotland:31d33451f05163bc8e46696038836205&#34;&gt;Scotland&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does any of that sound familiar in Scotland? I&amp;rsquo;d say it does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relationship between Scots, however loaded and vague that term is in today&amp;rsquo;s Scotland, and Scottish Standard English, is not at all unlike the nynorsk/bokmål divide. SSE is essentially a more Scottified version (quite a bit in pronunciation, less so in other areas) of a closely related language that gained prestige by virtue of being associated with a politically dominant southern neighbour. Any legitimacy that Scots can claim comes, on the one hand, from the relative strength of traditional dialects in rural parts such as the north-east and the Northern Isles, and on the other hand from its role as a vehicle for the expression of Scottish identity and a continuous link with a &amp;lsquo;more Scottish past&amp;rsquo;. Opponents of a Scots written culture of course deride it in turn as rural and uneducated or as a futile exercise by latte-swilling idealists who wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be caught dead anywhere near a farm in Banffshire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time the indigenous language, Gaelic, is confined to the remote and rural Highlands and Islands. Attempts to increase its profile in the Lowlands end up being attacked as supporting a dead language, a laughable relic of the past, and parents sending their children to Gaelic-medium schools derided as insufferable élitists happy to waste public money on something so inconsequential as Scotland&amp;rsquo;s ancient language. In parts of the Highlands people are altogether more &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.scotsman.com/news/scotland/top-stories/anti-gaelic-gunmen-shoot-road-sign-in-caithness-1-3075913&#34;&gt;trigger-happy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;not-the-same-of-course:31d33451f05163bc8e46696038836205&#34;&gt;Not the same, of course&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The parallels are by no means perfect. For instance, the average Scottish person in Ayr or Kirkcaldy is much happier to view the history and culture of the Highlands and Islands as authentically &amp;lsquo;Scottish&amp;rsquo; compared to the attitude of somebody from Hønefoss or Arendal to the Sámi – for one thing, the average Norwegian doesn&amp;rsquo;t really know much about the Sámi beyond the fact that they herd reindeer (actually, most of them don&amp;rsquo;t), wear funny hats and drink a lot. All right, one could question how much the average Lowlander &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; knows about Gaelic culture, but still, the days of the Highlanders as racially alien brutes are mostly past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A big consequence of this is that the relevance of Gaelic to contemporary Scotland is a subject of debate. That debate can be acrimonious and at times stupid, but it exists. Mainstream Norwegian society does not so much oppress the Sámi and Kvens as it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really care about them. The debate only exists in Northern Norway, and is wound up with all sorts of vexed questions about Northern identity in the broader Norwegian context that might again be quite reminiscent of the debates in Scotland or Catalonia – but for the average Norwegian the Sámi languages and Kven might as well be spoken on another planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing is that the Norwegian romantic nationalism that legitimized Ivar Aasen&amp;rsquo;s landsmål had no real counterpart in Scotland. Despite the importance of Ossianism, nineteenth-century Scotland was happy to see itself as a successful part of the British Empire, and did not need to legitimize itself through links to a glorious past (which is more than a bit ironic, given that Scots &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; the potential for building on the written tradition of Older Scots, whereas landsmål/nynorsk was self-consciously a modern creation rather than the continuation of a mediæval tradition – and look which has been more successful).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-politics-of-a-new-language:31d33451f05163bc8e46696038836205&#34;&gt;The politics of a new language&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_language_conflict&#34;&gt;Norwegian language struggle&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;språkstriden&lt;/em&gt;) teaches us is that the legitimacy of a language, whether spoken or written, has absolutely nothing to do with any objective linguistic distance. Bored high-schoolers in Oslo claim to not understand a word of nynorsk not because they don&amp;rsquo;t (this is a pretty laughable notion, to be honest) but because moaning about it is much more acceptable than to be seen making an effort to engage with it (unless you&amp;rsquo;re a swot). Northern Norwegians will tell you that it is so Western and far from their own dialect that they&amp;rsquo;d rather stick to bokmål, even though nynorsk did hold a &lt;a href=&#34;https://nn.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skulem%C3%A5l_i_Nord-Noreg&#34;&gt;strong position in significant parts of Northern Norway&lt;/a&gt; at some point – not to mention the fact that many northern Norwegian dialects are probably much more similar to nynorsk than to bokmål. In Norwegian politics, the code for &amp;lsquo;we hate nynorsk&amp;rsquo; is &amp;lsquo;families should have the freedom of choice&amp;rsquo;, buttressed by arguments such as &amp;lsquo;the immigrants get confused and don&amp;rsquo;t understand nynorsk&amp;rsquo; (this one always got me: these slogans are usually fronted by speakers of urban Eastern Norwegian varieties, and being used to Northern Norwegian I often struggled to understand &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt; because of the great difference in pitch accents – why don&amp;rsquo;t we abolish bokmål because, you know, there are quite a few immigrants who don&amp;rsquo;t understand &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;, either) – ironically, it is reported there are only two pupils in all of Oslo who insist on being taught in nynorsk, and, guess what, &lt;a href=&#34;http://framtida.no/articles/einaste-nynorskelevane-i-oslo-fordel-a-skriva-nynorsk&#34;&gt;they&amp;rsquo;re both from immigrant families&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further corollary is that the outcome does not necessarily come from the numerical strength of people willing to identify with a particular form of a language: perceived legitimacy and a political will are much more important. Here, it is instructive to compare Scotland with Northern Ireland: despite the Scottish government&amp;rsquo;s goodwill noises, actual political action to support Ulster-Scots has been much more extensive, despite the fact that Ulster-Scots has little if any independent tradition to fall back on and a very small base of people willing to support it. The obvious reason, of course, is that Ulster-Scots is caught up in the Northern Irish political football game as a counterpoint to the support for Irish promised by the Belfast Agreement (and &lt;a href=&#34;http://sluggerotoole.com/2014/01/09/cuts-and-splits-how-the-irish-language-communitys-most-effective-advocates-are-being-silenced/&#34;&gt;that&amp;rsquo;s not going extremely well, either&lt;/a&gt;), but that&amp;rsquo;s a story for another day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;so-where-does-this-leave-scotland:31d33451f05163bc8e46696038836205&#34;&gt;So, where does this leave Scotland?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the face of it, the similarities between Scots and nynorsk are undeniable, if not entirely compelling. Does it mean it could gain the same sort of recognition? In theory, yes, especially in an independent Scotland (or maybe a Scotland with more devolution, or even a Scotland  gaining independence at the second attempt).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reality, however, I would imagine that Gaelic is a better candidate for &amp;lsquo;Scotland&amp;rsquo;s nynorsk&amp;rsquo;. It already has widespread legitimacy as an authentic part of Scottish heritage, and, despite the loud opposition, support for measures such as Gaelic-medium education has been quietly growing. The idea that one day the culchie dialect made up by that Aasen crackpot will be taught in every school must have seemed ludicrous to a mid-19th century Oslo clerk, and yet that&amp;rsquo;s exactly what  happened. Despite the pressure nynorsk finds itself under, and despite the salutary lessons from Ireland, it does not seem impossible that, in the right circumstances, Gaelic may yet gain a foothold in mainstream Scottish society. It will always remains a niche pursuit, but the Norwegian example shows that concerted action may yet provide a strong foundation for its maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what of Scots? Again, in theory the same type of action might build a base for it too. In practice, it faces an uphill battle: the framing of &lt;em&gt;riksmål&lt;/em&gt; as &amp;lsquo;too Danish&amp;rsquo; could be a successful strategy in the romantic-nationalist Norway of the 19th century, but attacks on Standard Scottish English as &amp;lsquo;too English&amp;rsquo; are unlikely to sway many people in 21st-century Scotland. In a reversal of our Norwegian parallels, I would suggest that its best hope is building a strong regional base: just as Sámi is much more important  in Northern Norway without having much of an impact down south, so written Scots – perhaps in a more regionalized Scotland – could gain legitimacy in a more local context. But I don&amp;rsquo;t know quite enough about that part of the world to make any definite pronouncements.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;This poster considers the status of the &amp;lsquo;tense&amp;rsquo;/&amp;lsquo;lax&amp;rsquo; contrasts across Welsh dialects and argues that it was originally an enhancement of quantity, but becomes phonologized in different ways across different dialect.

<description>&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know what, if anything, will be happening here, but I do sometimes get the urge to rant about things that tweets are too short for. So I&amp;rsquo;ve just this up for now, and hopefully its existence will motivate me to write a bit more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait and see, in other words.&lt;/p&gt;
