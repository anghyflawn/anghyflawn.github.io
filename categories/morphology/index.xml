&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Indo-European language family&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Celtic languages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Topics in the phonology of European languages&lt;/li&gt;

<guid>http://anghyflawn.github.io/teaching/2017/lel2d/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;This course is part of the pre-Honours sequence in all LEL single Honours degrees, as well as of some joint degrees (in addition to being available as an outside course). Its main aim is to familiarize students with the study of linguistic diversity and the relationship between language typology and theory-building. In &lt;sup&gt;2016&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2017&lt;/sub&gt;, I am acting as the course organizer for LEL2D. I am also responsible for the entire phonology block. You can get some idea of its contents by looking at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://resourcelists.ed.ac.uk/lists/1713C19C-E564-12A2-D85D-27A30B730228.html&#34;&gt;Resource List&lt;/a&gt; for last year&amp;rsquo;s course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Course materials will be available on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.learn.ed.ac.uk&#34;&gt;Learn&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<guid>http://anghyflawn.github.io/teaching/2017/historical-phonology/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In this course (co-taught with my colleagues &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/homes/patrick&#34;&gt;Patrick Honeybone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/people/michael-ramsammy&#34;&gt;Michael Ramsammy&lt;/a&gt;) we consider a variety of issues connected to phonological change. Throughout the course, we address questions such as the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do we reconstruct the phonology of past language states?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What types of phonological changes are attested?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can synchronic phonological theory assist us in the study of historical phonology?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What can we learn about the human language faculty by studying historical phonology?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;sup&gt;2016&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2017&lt;/sub&gt;, I will cover the following topics (subject to change with extreme prejudice):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mechanisms and types of phonological change&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phonological typology and phonological change&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Historical phonology and phonological representations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

<title>Celtic, English, and Norse in Contact</title>
<link>http://anghyflawn.github.io/teaching/2017/celtic-norse-english/</link>
<pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
<guid>http://anghyflawn.github.io/teaching/2017/celtic-norse-english/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;This course has three main objectives:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An introduction to Celtic linguistics, via familiarizing students with the structural properties of Celtic languages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An brief introduction to the study of language contact, with particular attention to criteria used to diagnose contact features&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A discussion of various ways in which Celtic and North Germanic languages interacted with each other and with English in the British Isles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This course presupposes &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; knowledge of any modern or ancient Celtic language. However, it is also open to students pursuing Honours degrees in Celtic, as long as they have passed one of the second-year Gaelic courses &amp;mdash; while some of the linguistic concepts may require a bit of effort (especially if you haven&amp;rsquo;t taken at least LEL1 in pre-Honours), much of the language material will be familiar or sufficiently similar to Gaelic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may be helpful (albeit not at all obligatory) for the early part of the course (which isn&amp;rsquo;t really about linguistics) to get some background on the early medieval period in Britain and Ireland. For a light but very informative introduction, one suggestion is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theambulist.co.uk/books/journeys&#34;&gt;Max Adams&amp;rsquo; &lt;em&gt;In the land of giants&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the preliminary weekly plan for this year, subject to change with extreme prejudice&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introduction and the historical setting

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Celtic and the Anglo-Saxon conquest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Celtic and English in the Middle Ages. The Norse presence in England, Scotland, and Ireland&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Language shift. &amp;lsquo;Celtic Englishes&amp;rsquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Celtic language structures

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Old Irish&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modern Irish phonology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modern Irish morphosyntax&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Celtic language structures continued

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scottish Gaelic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Middle Welsh&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modern Welsh phonology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Celtic language structures; language contact

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modern Welsh morphosyntax&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An introduction to language contact. Agency in language contact&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sociolinguistic complexity and language contact&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Language contact; early Celtic-English contacts

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diagnosing historical language contact&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &amp;lsquo;Celtic hypothesis&amp;rsquo;: was Early English influenced by Celtic?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Celtic hypothesis; the Norse influence in the Atlantic Isles

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Celtic hypothesis continued&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Norse influence in the Old and Middle English periods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Norse influence in Scotland

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Class test (worth 30% of the mark)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Norse influence and Gaelic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Celtic, Norse and Scots in the Northern Isles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Celtic Englishes

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Irish English&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Celtic, Scots and Scottish English&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Celtic Englishes continued

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Welsh English&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;lsquo;Substrate&amp;rsquo; transfer vs. learning mechanisms. Simplification under contact conditions and &amp;lsquo;Angloversals&amp;rsquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Course summary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The remaining 70% of the mark will be assessed by a final essay of 3,000 words, to be written between the end of teaching and the start of the exam period.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Making sense of consonant palatalization vowel backness in Irish</title>
<link>http://anghyflawn.github.io/presentation/2016/ldlt5/</link>
<pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
<guid>http://anghyflawn.github.io/presentation/2016/ldlt5/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Despite its status as a minority language, Modern Irish has a rich body of phonetic and phonological descriptions, based on (near-)native fieldworker knowledge and traditional auditory methods. In this paper, we draw on a range of up-to-date instrumental and quantitative methods in order to verify and expand the traditional findings regarding the nature and status of the interaction between consonant palatalization and vowel backness in Irish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the descriptive literature, there are several types of consonant-to-vowel coarticulation in Modern Irish. In the case of long vowels, the distribution of front and back vowels is free with respect to surrounding consonant palatalization: &lt;em&gt;ciúin&lt;/em&gt; /k&amp;rsquo;uːn&amp;rsquo;/ &amp;lsquo;quiet&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;buíon&amp;rsquo; /biːn/ &amp;lsquo;company&amp;rsquo;. However, descriptions recognize the phonetic reality of &amp;lsquo;on-&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;off-glides&amp;rsquo; when the backness of the long vowel does not match that of the neighbouring consonant: [kʲuːʲn], [bʷiːˠn]. In the case of short vowels, it is commonly argued that (some) front and back vowels show complementary distribution driven by consonant palatalization, such that, for instance, &lt;em&gt;giobal&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lsquo;rag&amp;rsquo; (surface [ɡʲʊbəl]) and &lt;em&gt;duine&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lsquo;man&amp;rsquo; (surface [dɪnʲə]) both contain the underlying segment (phoneme) /ɯ/, and are derived from /ɡ&amp;rsquo;ɯbəl/ and /dɯn&amp;rsquo;ə/ by &amp;lsquo;vowel separation&amp;rsquo; rules. At the same time, some of the more careful phonetic descriptions also recognize the existence of finely grained (though apparently categorical) vowel allophony driven by consonant palatalization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We report the results of a project aiming to disentangle the categorical and gradient aspects of this coarticulation using instrumental methods. Previous studies  show that for low vowels the effect of consonant palatalization on the quality of adjacent vowels cannot be described as simply a &amp;lsquo;glide&amp;rsquo; &amp;mdash; the consonant exerts an influence throughout the duration of the vowel &amp;mdash; and that consonant-vowel coarticulation in Irish is gradient. In this paper, we focus on a controlled acoustic study of &lt;em&gt;short&lt;/em&gt; vowels, claimed in the literature to undergo both categorical (complementary distribution) and gradient (fine-grained allophony) coarticulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We present the results of fitting a variety of generalized additive mixed models  to the acoustic data, and show that both kinds of effects co-exist in Modern Irish: a categorical rule enforcing (near-)allophony and gradient consonant-vowel coarticulation. We argue that this is a theoretically interesting example of the phenomenon of &amp;lsquo;rule scattering&amp;rsquo;, which would have been difficult to establish with confidence solely on the basis of traditional descriptions. We also discuss some of the challenges associated with gathering balanced data (necessary for quantitative analysis) using reading tasks from a minority language, even one with a well-established tradition of literacy.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Short vowel allophones in Modern Irish</title>
<link>http://anghyflawn.github.io/presentation/2016/tionol/</link>

<guid>http://anghyflawn.github.io/presentation/2016/tionol/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;We present the results of a study of the acoustic properties of short vowels in Modern Irish, building on data from all three major dialect groupings. It is well known that short vowels in Irish are realized as back or front depending on the palatalization of the surrounding consonants (thus &lt;em&gt;liom&lt;/em&gt; [u] but &lt;em&gt;linn&lt;/em&gt; [i]). In addition, traditional descriptions also recognize that vowels can also have a number of distinct allophones whose distribution also depends on surrounding consonants: for instance, De Bhaldraithe (1945) describes four distinct varieties of [a] in Cois Fhairrge Irish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We conduct an acoustic and statistical analysis of the pronunciations of short vowels by speakers of all three major dialects of Irish in order to evaluate the relative contribution of the two kinds of consonant influence on vowel phonetics. We show that the distribution of the coarser categories (e.g. [i] vs. [u]) is largely predictable and mostly follows the generalizations that can be extracted from the traditional descriptive literature (e.g. Ó Maolalaigh 1998). However, the finer-grained allophony does not require setting up discrete categories as in the traditional descriptions, but instead emerges from the interplay of various continuous factors.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Tonal stability and tonogenesis in North Germanic</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;The origin of North Germanic tonal accents is a question with a long history and a range of available answers. Although the basic facts are not in dispute, the accents&amp;rsquo; historical development remains controversial. In this paper, I aim to contribute an argument in favour of the view that tonal accent arose in post-Viking Age North Germanic in connection with changes in syllable count (Oftedal 1952; Elstad 1980; Bye 2004, 2011; Hognestad 2012). I will argue that the genesis of &amp;lsquo;accent 1&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;accent 2&amp;rsquo; as a grammaticalization of syllable count need not be seen as an isolated, unique phenomenon in the history of the North Germanic languages: instead, it is a recurring event, as demonstrated by the genesis of new &amp;lsquo;tonal accent&amp;rsquo; oppositions triggered by apocope in at least three further separate instances in Central Scandinavia, Zealand, and East Slesvig. I also adduce further typological parallels from West Germanic and from Goidelic Celtic.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The phonologization of redundancy</title>
<link>http://anghyflawn.github.io/writing/welsh-vowels-phonologization/</link>

<guid>http://anghyflawn.github.io/writing/welsh-vowels-phonologization/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;‘Phonologization’ is a process whereby a phonetic phenomenon enters the phonological grammar and becomes conceptualized as the result of categorical manipulation of phonological symbols. I analyse the phonologization of a predictable phonological pattern in Welsh, with particular attention to identifying criteria for whether phonologization has occurred. I argue for a model where phonologization experiences bottom-up and top-down biases. From the bottom up, there is pressure to phonologize phenomena with a categorical distribution; from the top down, there exist formal constraints on featural specification. I focus on the requirement for featural specifications to obey the Contrastivist Hypothesis, which denies that redundant features can be involved in phonological computation, in the context of a framework with emergent features. I suggest that the Contrastivist Hypothesis acts as a useful check for emergent-feature theories, whilst independent phonologization criteria provide contrastivist approaches with a more solid conceptual underpinning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper has been resubmitted to &lt;em&gt;Phonology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also download the &lt;a href=&#34;http://anghyflawn.github.io/misc/welsh-phonologization-paper.nb.html&#34;&gt;R notebook with the graphics and scripts from the paper&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The ATR/Laryngeal connection and emergent features</title>
<link>http://anghyflawn.github.io/writing/calediad/</link>
<pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
<guid>http://anghyflawn.github.io/writing/calediad/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I consider an unusual sound change and synchronic alternation in south-eastern dialects of Welsh, traditionally referred to as ‘provection’ (Welsh &lt;em&gt;calediad&lt;/em&gt;). This phenomenon involves the ‘devoicing’ of stops following stressed vowels. I suggest that it may be the result of a typologically rare sort of vowel-consonant featural interaction, where ‘devoicing’ is triggered by tense vowels. This is unexpected typologically, since tongue root advancement — often a correlate of ‘tense’ vowel quality — is more frequently associated with voicing rather than devoicing in obstruents. I argue that in Welsh the phonologization of the quality distinction in stressed vowels has created a system where such an interaction is dispreferred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suggest that the unusual consonant-vowel interaction in south-eastern Welsh is facilitated by the phonological ambiguity of the ‘tenseness’ contrast in vowels. Although the distinction between ‘tense’ and ‘lax’ vowel pairs is made consistently in most Welsh dialects, it is often fairly inert phonologically. This makes it possible for it to become involved in a variety of phonological processes. I survey the diversity of ways in which quantity-quality interactions in vowels found across Welsh dialects, and argue that the attested multiple paths of phonologization support a bottom-up, substance-free approach to phonologization. I suggest that the particular strength of the substance-free model lies in its ability to account for different — sometimes drastically so — phonological behaviour emerging from ambiguous data.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Optimality Theory: Motivations and perspectives</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;This chapter provides an introduction to the basic mechanisms of Optimality Theory in phonology and to the most important motivations cited for its widespread adoption. I also review some of the empirical and conceptual challenges it has faced. Ultimately, I suggest, many of these challenges can be traced back to the fact that while OT grew out of a general dissatisfaction with some aspects of late-1980s rule-based phonology, it was adopted as a general theory of phonological computation without an explicit statement of the division of labour vis-à-vis other components of linguistic knowledge with which it interacts. I conclude the chapter by a discussion of ways in which OT still remains relevant even within a changed phonological landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chapter is ©Routledge&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The northwest European phonological area</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;This is a local colloquium talk with some preliminary ideas on the topic. If you have any kind of feedback, do please get in touch!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I discuss the recurrence of several cross-linguistically rare phonological phenomena in unrelated languages spoken in northwestern Europe. Identified already by Jakobson in the 1930s as forming part of a &amp;lsquo;Baltic&amp;rsquo; Sprachbund defined by the use of &amp;lsquo;tonality&amp;rsquo;, the northwest European &amp;lsquo;phonological province&amp;rsquo; is characterized by the presence of features such as preaspiration (North Germanic, Sámi, Scottish Gaelic &amp;mdash; but also Welsh and English), tonal accents and laryngealization (North Germanic, Scottish Gaelic, West Germanic, Baltic &amp;mdash; and some Finnic languages), sonorant pre-occlusion (in North Germanic, Sámi, Cornish, Manx), and excrescent vowels (Sámi, Irish and Scottish Gaelic, some West Germanic varieties). These similarities have been long recognized, but frequently ascribed to bilateral contact (e.g. North Germanic → Sámi or North Germanic → Goidelic Celtic) or considered &amp;lsquo;typological&amp;rsquo; in some vaguely defined sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reconsider the nature of these similarities taking into account the availability of new data and new analytical tools. It is apparent that the occurrence of the relevant &amp;lsquo;rare&amp;rsquo; phenomena has been underestimated, since they often function in a variable way, and only in some cases do they become categorical phenomena. I also draw attention to the fact that in many cases the origin and functioning of the relevant phenomena is closely connected with metrical (in particular foot and moraic) structure. This, I suggest, indicates that the role of contact may have been overstated, and that the appearance of rare phenomena such as phonological preaspiration and tonal accents may be due to the (re)use of laryngeal phonetic cues to metrical structure.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Why Gaelic should belong to us all</title>
<link>http://anghyflawn.github.io/blog/2016/gaelic-belongs-to-all/</link>
<pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>

<description>&lt;p&gt;Another day, another stooshie on Scottish Twitter. This time it&amp;rsquo;s Paul Kavanagh sharing some really lovely maps of Lowland areas with Gaelic placenames that he&amp;rsquo;s made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;I&amp;#39;m drawing Gaelic maps cos Scotland has 2 national languages of its own, yet all our maps are in English. &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/uBN0hXsD9U&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/uBN0hXsD9U&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Paul Kavanagh (@weegingerdug) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/weegingerdug/status/780218426027630592&#34;&gt;September 26, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cue some really rather unenlightened comments with all the usual accusations and allegations (&amp;lsquo;never spoken here&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;pushing it down our throats&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;dead language&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;spend it on hospitals instead&amp;rsquo;), and equally noisy pushback. Paul himself was moved to write a &lt;a href=&#34;https://weegingerdug.wordpress.com/2016/09/27/drawing-a-gaelic-map-of-glasgow-makes-you-a-fascist/&#34;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; that has also been well shared (even, judging by my Facebook feed, by people not normally part of the absorbing world of Scottish political Twitter).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to start with: it is absolutely correct that most of the anti-Gaelic stuff has a tenuous hold on reality. There is almost too much excellent writing on the Internet dealing with this, but have a look at &lt;a href=&#34;https://basedrones.wordpress.com/2015/09/04/scots-gaelic-scots-law-and-scots-attitudes/&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; by Malcolm Combe or &lt;a href=&#34;http://bellacaledonia.org.uk/2014/06/12/language-and-largs/&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; by Daibhidh Rothach or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/oct/29/dont-neglect-uks-indigenous-languages&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; by Rhona NicDhùghaill or &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@1ngi/what-a-stupid-scrabble-article-taught-me-about-welsh-bc4f315490c9#.1z19ckeru&#34;&gt;even this&lt;/a&gt; by Ingi Birchell Hughes (it&amp;rsquo;s about Welsh, but the silliness is much the same).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should be able to take preposterous claims and call them preposterous. It is not true that Gaelic was never spoken in the Lowlands, and yes, that includes Aberdeenshire (home to the abbey of Deer, itself home to the Book of Deer, commonly recognized as the earliest source for specifically Scottish Gaelic texts as opposed to standard Old Irish), Fife (with, for instance, &lt;em&gt;baile&lt;/em&gt; names found all the way to the East Neuk) and the Lothians (&lt;em&gt;Balerno&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Inveresk&lt;/em&gt; being clear examples).&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The dastardly signs seem to me be a distinct rarity in the Lowlands (not being a driver, I have no idea how many bilingual signs there are on the M8, but I suspect not a great deal). In Edinburgh, where I live, I know of (mostly well hidden) Gaelic signs at Waverley and Haymarket stations (well, the smaller stations like &lt;em&gt;Gyle a Dheas&lt;/em&gt; too), bilingual branding in the Scottish Parliament, and some signs around Edinburgh University (mostly for things like the School of Literatures, Languages and Cultures and the School of Scottish Studies Archives, where not having them would be a very poor show indeed!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, as Malcolm touches on in his blog, the idea of Scotland as some kind of Gaelic dictatorship where vital resources are channelled away from vital spending areas is so far off the mark it&amp;rsquo;s laughable. In Tromsø, in the far north of Norway, where I did my PhD, &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; signs at the university (and the university hospital) are bilingual Norwegian-Northern Sámi (or trilingual with English). In Wales, &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; road signs are bilingual (not just those in Welsh-speaking areas) and give or take &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; school pupils are meant to do Welsh at school. In Scotland, we don&amp;rsquo;t even have a right to Gaelic-medium education enshrined in law, so give me a break &amp;mdash; if the government wanted to really &lt;em&gt;impose&lt;/em&gt; Gaelic on everyone, they are doing a piss-poor job of it. (But then, as I&amp;rsquo;ve said &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/devolution/2016/01/what-does-scots-language-have-do-scottish-identity&#34;&gt;elsewhere&lt;/a&gt; the SNP aren&amp;rsquo;t really a language-rights party à la Plaid.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, there&amp;rsquo;s a but. Much as I would have liked to endorse the arguments of those who defend Paul&amp;rsquo;s Gaelic maps venture, I confess I feel a distinct unease at promoting Gaelic primarily as a vehicle for Scottish culture. For the avoidance of doubt, I have absolutely no time for the argument that promoting Gaelic is some kind of dastardly SNP plot to manufacture artificial difference, or that Gaelic culture has no worth in the modern world (the &amp;lsquo;dead language&amp;rsquo; canard). Those arguments are preposterous too. And yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;History and heritage and culture are important, and they might sway some people, but others &amp;mdash; who do not happen to share that particular sense of history and identity &amp;mdash; will be much more difficult to persuade. This is not (I think) where the main arguments for promoting Gaelic should be. The main argument is that it is a real language spoken by real people here and now who have real rights. And one of those rights should be to live as much of their lives as possible through Gaelic &amp;mdash; and in an English-dominant society they need help. (Scott Hames makes some related points on Scots &lt;a href=&#34;http://bellacaledonia.org.uk/2016/02/19/not-nationality-but-language/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aspect of the Gaelic Language Act I like most is its insistence that Gaelic is a national language of Scotland. All people living here, whether they live in Stornoway or Jedburgh, Stranraer or Lerwick, whether they have a Highland family background or are just interested in the culture, whether they support independence or the union, should all have equal rights to Gaelic. Dragging it into nationalist vs. unionist Twitter fights does not help. The language should not be put into any kind of box, whether constitutional or political or regional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I disagree with people who say that funding for Gaelic should be focused on areas where it &amp;lsquo;has a chance&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/anghyflawn&#34;&gt;@anghyflawn&lt;/a&gt; Government policy can&amp;#39;t keep the language alive (though it can help); that&amp;#39;s up to the people themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; alexmassie (@alexmassie) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/alexmassie/status/699555698410041344&#34;&gt;February 16, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-conversation=&#34;none&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/anghyflawn&#34;&gt;@anghyflawn&lt;/a&gt; Yes. I&amp;#39;m in favour of public-funding for gaelic; but against the pretence it&amp;#39;s a national, rather than regional, language.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; alexmassie (@alexmassie) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/alexmassie/status/699554564047921153&#34;&gt;February 16, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If (say) you grow up with Gaelic but want to pursue opportunities available to you in areas where such targeted support is absent, such a policy essentially forces you to choose between opportunity and getting help with sticking to Gaelic &amp;mdash; and then gets you blamed for not caring enough. This is what any such division produces. And there is the same danger if the &amp;lsquo;box&amp;rsquo; becomes party-political.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is with such arguments that we should engage. Fights over identity and culture and belonging are fun but don&amp;rsquo;t look good to outsiders. Let&amp;rsquo;s see opponents build a positive case for depriving people of their rights instead. There &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; rational arguments against the promotion of minority languages; I would probably disagree with most of them, but let&amp;rsquo;s have them out in the open in a grown-up manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I hear you say, who cares, it&amp;rsquo;s a Twitter fight. But Twitter fights are loud, and it looks like some MSPs are listening:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;.&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/pressjournal&#34;&gt;@pressjournal&lt;/a&gt; covers my attempts to seek flexibility from the Scottish Govt on the Gaelic language plan in Aberdeen &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/yJ8ob8S2vV&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/yJ8ob8S2vV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Ross Thomson MSP (@RossThomsonMSP) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/RossThomsonMSP/status/767006528767418368&#34;&gt;August 20, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, the Conservative and Unionist Party remains committed to Gaelic, at least as far as its manifesto commitments go. But for how long, if the debate slips onto the usual nationalist vs. unionist rails? And if you&amp;rsquo;re a supporter of Gaelic, do you really want this to happen? The SNP will not be in power for ever. To keep support for the language, we need it to be broad and above party-political disagreements. Look to Northern Ireland, where an Irish Language Act has stalled for years because it&amp;rsquo;s tangled up in constitutional disagreements. So &amp;mdash; &lt;em&gt;careful now&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;In any case, you don&amp;rsquo;t need local Gaelic &lt;em&gt;speakers&lt;/em&gt; to have a Gaelic &lt;em&gt;name&lt;/em&gt; for a place: English has (had) no problem with calling &lt;em&gt;München&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Venezia&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Pfalz&lt;/em&gt; Munich, Venice and the Palatinate. For instance, the Gaelic name for Linlithgow (&lt;em&gt;Gleann Iucha&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gaelicplacenames.org/databasedetails.php?id=401&#34;&gt;was well-known among Highlanders&lt;/a&gt; even if they never visited.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[return]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

<title>Welsh svarabhakti as stem allomorphy</title>
<link>http://anghyflawn.github.io/writing/svarabhakti/</link>

<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper develops the analysis in &lt;a href=&#34;http://anghyflawn.github.io/presentation/2012/the-phonological-endgame:-welsh-svarabhakti-revisited/&#34;&gt;this presentation&lt;/a&gt;. I offer an analysis of Welsh epenthesis, whereby a copy of a preceding vowel is inserted to break up final clusters of rising sonority (&lt;em&gt;pwdr&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lsquo;rotten&amp;rsquo; is [pudur] rather than *[pudr]) and deletion in such clusters in polysyllables (&lt;em&gt;perygl&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lsquo;danger&amp;rsquo; is [perɪɡ] rather than *[perɪɡl]). It has previously been argued that both processes can be analysed in a single phonological grammar. I show that this is not tenable for South Welsh dialects, and propose an analysis in terms of part-of-speech-specific allomorphy, formalized as lexical storage of POS-characterized stems rather than roots.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Problems of phonemicization</title>
<link>http://anghyflawn.github.io/presentation/2016/clc9/</link>
<pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
<guid>http://anghyflawn.github.io/presentation/2016/clc9/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;We address a long-standing issue in the phonology of Modern Irish: the phonological status of the distinction between front and back short vowels. We argue that the approach inherent in most theoretical work on the topic, which privileges traditional &amp;lsquo;phonemic&amp;rsquo; criteria such as predictability of distribution, misses important generalizations and cannot be sustained. Instead, we suggest that front and back (non-low) vowels in Irish are best thought of as phonologically &amp;lsquo;distinctive&amp;rsquo;, but not (significantly) &amp;lsquo;contrastive&amp;rsquo; units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We reconsider the arguments for the noncontrastive status of the front/back distinction in short vowels in Modern Irish, on the basis of a cross-dialectal acoustic study. Our results show that the distributional generalizations offered in Roibeard Ó Maolalaigh&amp;rsquo;s (1997) summary of the traditional description literature, which suggests the distinction is largely allophonic, are by and large correct.  Our quantitative analysis, which relies on model comparison methods applied to generalized additive mixed models, also shows that front and back vowels form distinct categories in the output of the phonology: models that assume more than one backness category per height achieve better fit than ones assuming a surface &amp;lsquo;vertical&amp;rsquo; system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We conclude that front and back vowels form distinct categories that are accessible to the phonological grammar, and offer an interpretation of the facts centred around the notion of &amp;lsquo;quasi-phonemes&amp;rsquo;: phonologically distinct elements that do not stand in contrastive distribution. We argue that this framework allows us to unify the description of the low functional load of the distribution and the analysis of vowel backness alternations in the synchronic grammar. We show that our analysis, which does not predict fully complementary distribution, is superior to previous approaches that relied on &amp;lsquo;vowel separation&amp;rsquo; rules to achieve the same outcome, since it correctly predicts the possibility of exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This work builds on that presented at &lt;a href=&#34;http://anghyflawn.github.io/presentation/2016/vowel-backness-and-palatalization-in-irish-scottish-gaelic-study-in-rule-scattering/&#34;&gt;OCP13&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://anghyflawn.github.io/presentation/2016/backness-in-irish-and-scottish-gaelic-short-vowels-phonology-and-or-coarticulation/&#34;&gt;FiSK 2016&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Scots not a language? They said that in Ukraine too</title>
<link>http://anghyflawn.github.io/blog/2016/scots-not-language-they-said-that-in-ukraine-too/</link>
<pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
<guid>http://anghyflawn.github.io/blog/2016/scots-not-language-they-said-that-in-ukraine-too/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;It seems that the Twitter mocking of the weekly Scots column in &lt;a href=&#34;www.thenational.scot&#34;&gt;The National&lt;/a&gt; has assumed the quality of a ritual. There is a lot to be said about this (I said &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/devolution/2016/01/what-does-scots-language-have-do-scottish-identity&#34;&gt;a bit&lt;/a&gt; when the whole thing just launched). Today&amp;rsquo;s post is on a fairly narrow topic: how the debate about whether Scots &amp;lsquo;is a language&amp;rsquo; has a nice parallel in the history of the East Slavic languages Ukrainian and Belarusian. Maybe, just maybe, recognizing that the Scottish debates aren&amp;rsquo;t unique could broaden them a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, the position that Ukrainian and Belarusian are &amp;lsquo;distinct languages&amp;rsquo; rather than some kind of &amp;lsquo;broken Russian&amp;rsquo; is completely uncontroversial everywhere except some fairly fringe Russian nationalist circles&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:Not-that-it-necessarily-stops-many-Russians-from-making-fun-of-these-languages-mostly-at-the-level-of-the-Welsh-for-microwave-is-popty-ping&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:Not-that-it-necessarily-stops-many-Russians-from-making-fun-of-these-languages-mostly-at-the-level-of-the-Welsh-for-microwave-is-popty-ping&#34;&gt;0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; That was not at all the situation in the 19th century, when it was common to argue that (to simplify) there was a single Russian &amp;lsquo;language&amp;rsquo; (&lt;em&gt;jazyk&lt;/em&gt;) divided into several &amp;lsquo;dialects&amp;rsquo; (&lt;em&gt;narečije&lt;/em&gt;), including northern and southern &amp;lsquo;Great Russian&amp;rsquo; (Russian), &amp;lsquo;Little Russian&amp;rsquo; (Ukrainian) and &amp;lsquo;White Russian&amp;rsquo; (Belarusian). Some not dissimilar insinuations were also part of the official line in the later Soviet period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crucially, the written traditions underlying these languages&amp;rsquo; modern standard forms are relatively recent, going back to the late 18th century (Ukrainian) or even the second half of the 19th (Belarusian). These modern standards often show clear influence from the socially dominant Russian norm, enforced particularly after the early Soviet policy of &amp;lsquo;indigenization&amp;rsquo; was trashed in the 1930s in favour of more or less covert Russification. Indeed, both Belarusian and Ukrainian still have some irredentist proponents of earlier, less Russified, standards, which have sometimes survived in emigrant communities outside the Soviet Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These debates (already strongly echoed by the weekly rejection of written Scots as &amp;lsquo;just standard English with changed vowels&amp;rsquo;&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:2&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) provide a further interesting twist. Any Scots standard has to walk the tightrope between traditional Scots, just about clinging on in parts of the country but not really part of most people&amp;rsquo;s everyday experience, and more or less standard varieties of Scottish English, which is what most people speak. The discontinuity between Older Scots and Scottish English creates a funny authenticity requirement, where attempts at writing modern Scots with all its English influence are dismissed as &amp;lsquo;contaminated&amp;rsquo;, by contrast with the &amp;lsquo;pure&amp;rsquo; Scots of earlier writers. Funnily enough, in practice the list of these earlier writers tends to boil down to Robert Burns, who was absolutely not averse to Anglicizing a rhyme or three (whether simply to make the verse work or to make the poems more acceptable to a southern audience) &amp;mdash; there are some examples &lt;a href=&#34;https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NHOepipqw5MC&amp;amp;lpg=PA121&amp;amp;ots=B1XzH0cP7Q&amp;amp;pg=PA120#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m going to be charitable here and assume people who invoke his spirit just ignore this fact to make their point rather than just lazily name the one acceptably canonized Scots writer they know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian and Belarusian suffer from much the same discontinuity. Before the Mongol invasions, the standard written language of the Old Rus&amp;rsquo; state was fairly uniform (discounting Church Slavonic influence and the amazing &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/19/world/europe/where-mud-is-archaeological-gold-russian-history-grew-on-trees.html&#34;&gt;Novgorod birch bark documents&lt;/a&gt;), but in the later Middle Ages there was a clear divergence between the written language of Muscovy and the written language of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (contrary to what one might expect from the name given today&amp;rsquo;s realities, this was a state with a mostly Slavic élite). This &amp;lsquo;Ruthenian&amp;rsquo; language, while building on the older tradition, was clearly influenced by the dialects that would evolve into today&amp;rsquo;s Belarusian and Ukrainian varieties while also accepting Polish influence, especially after the Union with Poland. However, by the end of the 17th century this variety was driven out of use by Polish in Poland and Church Slavonic and later modern Russian in the Russian Empire, and the elaboration of the &amp;lsquo;new&amp;rsquo; standards began mostly from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This provides, I think, a fairly clear parallel: modern Ukrainian, Belarusian and Scots all have (or aspire to) &amp;lsquo;new&amp;rsquo; standards that do  not go back in a direct line to the late medieval period.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:3&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; There are obvious similarities between the modern and the old standards (especially salient when they are also differences from the dominant language), because they build on more or less the same kinds of dialect. At the same time the newer standards also show clear influences from closely related, socially dominant languages (Russian or English) compared to an abstractly &amp;lsquo;pure&amp;rsquo; form of the smaller language. But &amp;mdash; and here I finally come to the point I want to make &amp;mdash; that&amp;rsquo;s not normally seen &amp;mdash; at least by reasonable people &amp;mdash; as a fatal flaw for the legitimacy of Belarusian and Ukrainian as &amp;lsquo;real languages&amp;rsquo;. And therein lies, perhaps, some hope for Scots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By way of final disclaimer, I claim no credit for being the first to come up with these parallels. Indeed the Russian scholar Alexander Pavlenko has also extended the similarities to the modern sociolinguistic situations of Scots vs. Ukrainian and Belarusian, so if you&amp;rsquo;re after more depth, see these papers by him:&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Morphology and dialectology: A quantitative approach</title>
<link>http://anghyflawn.github.io/presentation/2016/rnag2016/</link>
<pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
<guid>http://anghyflawn.github.io/presentation/2016/rnag2016/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;We present a study of Gaelic dialectal variation based on the unpublished, morphological section of the Linguistic Survey of Scotland (Gaelic). Our findings indicate that a quantitative (dialectometric) approach can yield important insights into the range of internal variation in Gaelic and elucidate certain issues of language structure. Here, we focus on two questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What patterns of spatial variation are observed in the morphological data?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How are different morphological features in the dialects correlated?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To answer the first question, we fit a logistic generalized additive model against a longitude-latitude spline and observe a number of patterns. Some features show a pronounced northwest-southeast cline, usually with more morphologically &amp;lsquo;innovative&amp;rsquo; dialects in the east and south. Demographic variables, such as mean age and concentrations of speakers, may be a factor. Others show a clear focus on the Outer Hebrides, particularly from North Uist southwards. This suggests that the Gaelic dialects of the southern Outer Hebrides are the most morphologically ‘conservative’ of the surviving varieties. Our approach allows us to precisely quantify these patterns, providing a firm underpinning for earlier descriptions. In some cases, the data also pose challenges for received pedagogical practice and prescriptive standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the second question, we use Ward clustering on a correlation matrix to identify which features frequently co-occur in the dialects. The results shed light both on the dialectal divisions of Gaelic and, arguably, on its grammatical structure. For instance, we identify a strong correlation between the absence of lenition in returns such as an cas (nominative), cas beag (nominative) and am fear (genitive). These patterns are not strongly correlated with other cases of lenition absence. We interpret this as suggesting that lenition in these contexts may be driven by a single grammatical mechanism (whose loss underlies this consistent absence of lenition), which is not in action in other lenition contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, our results show the potential of a quantitative approach to Gaelic dialectology and its promise for a larger study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The handout is slightly more detailed than these slides.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Vowel length in Shetland Norn</title>
<link>http://anghyflawn.github.io/presentation/2016/amc/</link>

<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the areas in which Scandinavian influence is apparent in the traditional Shetland Scots dialect is the distribution of vowel length: Shetland Scots generally follows the Scottish Vowel Length Rule, but also shows the complementary distribution of consonant and vowel length known from modern North Germanic languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the earliest development of Shetland Scots, three different systems of vowel length can be argued to have been in contact:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Nearly) unconstrained vowel length, as in Old Norse&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scandinavian combinatory vowel length&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Scottish Vowel Length Rule&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these systems were in the process of change in our time period, with System 1 giving way to System 2 across Scandinavia, and the SVLR also developing at about the same time. In both System 2 and the SVLR, we also observe the rise of an interaction between vowel quantity and ‘tense/lax’ quality. Thus, the system in Shetland Norn presents a set of interesting questions for the study of historical dialectology, language contact and historical phonology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give a detailed account of the distribution of vowel length in a 2m000-token sample of Jakob Jakobsen&amp;rsquo;s dictionary of Shetland Norn, and compare it to the contact systems. We show that clear traces of all three systems, as well as local innovations, are found in the data. We also place the Shetland Norn data in the context of both Scots and Scandinavian historical phonology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the handout has more detail than the slides.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The northwest European linguistic area</title>
<link>http://anghyflawn.github.io/presentation/2016/uit/</link>
<pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
<guid>http://anghyflawn.github.io/presentation/2016/uit/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In this talk I discuss the recurrence of several cross-linguistically rare phonological phenomena in unrelated languages spoken in northwestern Europe. Identified already by Jakobson in the 1930s as forming part of a &amp;lsquo;Baltic&amp;rsquo; Sprachbund defined by the use of &amp;lsquo;tonality&amp;rsquo;, the northwest European &amp;lsquo;phonological province&amp;rsquo; is characterized by the presence of features such as preaspiration (North Germanic, Sámi, Scottish Gaelic &amp;mdash; but also Welsh and English), tonal accents and laryngealization (North Germanic, Scottish Gaelic, West Germanic, Baltic &amp;mdash; and some Finnic languages), sonorant pre-occlusion (in North Germanic, Sámi, Cornish, Manx), and excrescent vowels (Sámi, Irish and Scottish Gaelic, some West Germanic varieties). These similarities have been long recognized (see Eliasson 2000, Rießler 2008 for relatively recent overviews), but frequently ascribed to bilateral contact (e.g. North Germanic &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; Sámi or North Germanic -&amp;gt; Goidelic Celtic).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reconsider the nature of these similarities taking into account the availability of new data and new analytical tools. It is apparent that the occurrence of the relevant &amp;lsquo;rare&amp;rsquo; phenomena has been underestimated, since they often function in a variable way, and only in some cases do they become categorical phenomena. I also draw attention to the fact that in many cases the origin and functioning of the relevant phenomena is closely connected with metrical (in particular foot and moraic) structure. This, I suggest, indicates that the role of contact may have been overstated, and that the appearance of rare phenomena such as phonological preaspiration and tonal accents may be due to the (re)use of laryngeal phonetic cues to metrical structure.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Prosodic structure and suprasegmental features</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;This paper sets out in detail the analysis first offered in my &lt;a href=&#34;http://anghyflawn.github.io/presentation/2013/non-contrastive-epenthetic-segments-as-surface-prosodic-structure/&#34;&gt;21mfm presentation&lt;/a&gt;. I examine the so-called &amp;lsquo;short-vowel stød&amp;rsquo; (&lt;em&gt;kortvokalstød&lt;/em&gt;) found in certain island dialects of Danish, which differs from the &amp;lsquo;common Danish&amp;rsquo; stød in that it is associated with light syllables (open syllable with short vowels or closed syllables with low-sonority codas) rather than heavy ones. I argue that it is best represented as a [constricted glottis] feature associated with a segmentally empty mora, which is projected due to top-down requirements on the internal structure of suprasegmental constituents. Thus, stød is interpreted as another example of a &amp;lsquo;tonal accent&amp;rsquo; phenomenon that submits to an analysis purely in terms of lexically stored metrical structure. I also offer an extension of the model which allows the direct association of features to suprasegmental constituents to Icelandic preaspiration.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Vowel backness and palatalization in Irish and Scottish Gaelic: A study in rule scattering</title>
<link>http://anghyflawn.github.io/presentation/2016/vowel-backness-and-palatalization-in-irish-scottish-gaelic-study-in-rule-scattering/</link>
<pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
<guid>http://anghyflawn.github.io/presentation/2016/vowel-backness-and-palatalization-in-irish-scottish-gaelic-study-in-rule-scattering/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;We present the results of an acoustic study of the interaction of consonant palatalization and vowel backness in Irish and Scottish Gaelic short vowels. Previous descriptions of Irish (but usually not of Scottish Gaelic) often describe the distribution of front vs. back nonlow vowels as predictable (allophonic). This makes Irish a potential example of a vertical vowel system. However, the sources are mostly impressionistic, and also tend to underplay the extent of variation within and across lexical items. Our study shows that the magnitude of coarticulation, whilst statistically detectable, is insufficient to account for the full range of front-back distinction. It is also comparable in Irish and in Scottish Gaelic. We argue that the interaction of palatalization and vowel backness in both languages is manifested both phonetically (as coarticulation) and phonologically (as symbolic fronting and backing rules), a situation described by Bermúdez-Otero (2015) as &amp;lsquo;rule scattering&amp;rsquo;. However, unlike other cases of rule scattering, the categorical pattern did not arise directly by phonologization of the gradient one.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;In this course (co-taught with my colleagues &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/homes/patrick&#34;&gt;Patrick Honeybone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/people/michael-ramsammy&#34;&gt;Michael Ramsammy&lt;/a&gt;) we consider a variety of issues connected to phonological change. Throughout the course, we address questions such as the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do we reconstruct the phonology of past language states?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What types of phonological changes are attested?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can synchronic phonological theory assist us in the study of historical phonology?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What can we learn about the human language faculty by studying historical phonology?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;sup&gt;2016&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2017&lt;/sub&gt;, I covered the following topics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phonological typology and historical phonology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The origins of sound change and phonologization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Historical phonology and phonological representations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

<title>Celtic, English, and Norse in Contact</title>
<link>http://anghyflawn.github.io/teaching/2016/celtic-norse-english/</link>
<pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
<guid>http://anghyflawn.github.io/teaching/2016/celtic-norse-english/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;This course runs for the first time in &lt;sup&gt;2015&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2016&lt;/sub&gt; (but will probably run every other year). It has three main objectives:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An introduction to Celtic linguistics, via familiarizing students with the structural properties of Celtic languages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An brief introduction to the study of language contact, with particular attention to criteria used to diagnose contact features&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A discussion of various ways in which Celtic and North Germanic languages interacted with each other and with English in the British Isles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This course presupposes &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; knowledge of any modern or ancient Celtic language. However, it is also open to students pursuing Honours degrees in Celtic, as long as they have passed one of the second-year Gaelic courses &amp;mdash; while some of the linguistic concepts may require a bit of effort (especially if you haven&amp;rsquo;t taken at least LEL1 in pre-Honours), much of the language material will be familiar or sufficiently similar to Gaelic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check this page later for a course handbook. In the meantime, here is a preliminary weekly plan (subject to change with extreme prejudice):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introduction and the historical setting

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Celtic and the Anglo-Saxon conquest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Celtic and English in the Middle Ages. The Norse presence in England, Scotland, and Ireland&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Language shift. &amp;lsquo;Celtic Englishes&amp;rsquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Celtic language structures: Old Irish. Modern Irish phonology and morphosyntax&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Celtic language structures: Scottish Gaelic. Middle Welsh. Modern Welsh phonology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Celtic language structures: Modern Welsh morphosyntax. Cornish and Breton. An introduction to language contact&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sociolinguistic complexity and types of language contact. Diagnosing historical contact. Class test (worth 30% of the mark)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Celtic hypothesis: was Early English influenced by Celtic?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contact with Norse: North Germanic and English. The Norse influence and Gaelic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Celtic Englishes: Irish English. Scotland.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Celtic Englishes: Welsh English. Cornwall and Brittany. Summary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The remaining 70% of the mark will be assessed by a final essay of 3,000 words, to be written between the end of teaching and the start of the exam period.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Phonetic (non-)explanation in historical phonology: Duration, harmony, and dissimilation</title>
<link>http://anghyflawn.github.io/presentation/2015/phonetic-non-explanation-in-historical-phonology-duration-harmony-and-dissimilation/</link>
<pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
<guid>http://anghyflawn.github.io/presentation/2015/phonetic-non-explanation-in-historical-phonology-duration-harmony-and-dissimilation/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;We consider the value of phonetically based explanations for phonological change by tracing the phonologization paths of durational asymmetries between vowels. The literature on phonetic motivations for phonological change identifies relative shortness of one vowel with respect to another as an important precursor to vowel reduction, which, in turn, may feed hypercorrection of the reduced vowel to give rise to vowel harmony phenomena. We examine such a case from Nivkh in detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other language, similar durational asymmetries fail to promote hypercorrection, instead becoming the basis of sound change whereby the height of vowels changes to adjust their inherent duration in line with the asymmetry. This promotes apparent dissimilation phenomena; we examine such a case from Irish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, durational asymmetries provoke both harmony and dissimilation as phonological changes. While this is unsurprising given the sotchastic nature of phonologization, we suggest that such cases weaken the &lt;em&gt;predictive&lt;/em&gt; power of &amp;lsquo;evolutionary&amp;rsquo; theories of sound change: without detailed phonetic information on the precursors of phonological change, it cannot be said that explanations eschewing a role for formal factors are not necessarily more explanatory than ones that do incorporate formal theorizing.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Book review: Pam na fu Cymru</title>
<link>http://anghyflawn.github.io/blog/2015/pam-na-fu-cymru/</link>
<pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
<guid>http://anghyflawn.github.io/blog/2015/pam-na-fu-cymru/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;What follows is a short(ish) review of an excellently provocative new(ish) book by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/SeimonBrooks&#34;&gt;Simon Brooks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Pam na fu Cymru: Methiant cenedlaetholdeb Cymraeg&lt;/em&gt; (&amp;lsquo;Why Wales wasn&amp;rsquo;t: The failure of Welsh nationalism&amp;rsquo;).&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It is, as the author notes, the second part of what may be deemed a trilogy, following from the no less interesting collection &lt;em&gt;Pa beth yr aethoch chi allan i&amp;rsquo;w achub?&lt;/em&gt; (&amp;lsquo;What did you go out to save?&amp;rsquo;), which also posed some rather less comfortable questions for the Welsh language (re)vitalization movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, Brooks&amp;rsquo; starting point is a denial of the &amp;lsquo;heroic narrative&amp;rsquo; of language survival, best expressed in Dafydd Iwan&amp;rsquo;s iconic &lt;em&gt;Yma o Hyd&lt;/em&gt; (&amp;lsquo;We&amp;rsquo;re still here&amp;rsquo;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/12DsDOHzmjE&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this story, which is pretty much the orthodox picture, plucky little Welsh survives despite the might of the British Empire, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.llgc.org.uk/index.php?id=thebluebooks&#34;&gt;Treachery of the Blue Books&lt;/a&gt;, industrialization, and all the rest of it, and its survival is due to the fantastic resilience of the Welsh speakers in the face of rather long odds. Brooks (not unconvincingly) utterly demolishes this story, pointing out (in chapter 1, &amp;lsquo;The unexpected failure of Welsh nationalism&amp;rsquo;) that pretty much all the minority communities of Europe (except maybe the Czechs) faced rather longer odds in terms of their economy, access to education and the printing press, and other factors usually seen to foster the growth of nationalism. Brooks is really failing to hold back his anger there. In the early 19th century Wales was far advanced along the modernization path, but the language was still very much alive, and in fact newcomers in the growing industrial areas of the south were being assimilated &lt;em&gt;into&lt;/em&gt; Welsh-speaking society &amp;mdash; and yet in terms of language preservation it has ended up behind not just the Czechs, Hungarians or Catalans, but much smaller and later developing nations like the Slovaks, Slovenians or Estonians. Brooks argues that although the situation in Central and Eastern Europe was different given the preponderance of multinational empires, it cannot be said that the Western European context would necessarily inhibit the growth of &amp;lsquo;new&amp;rsquo; nations &amp;mdash; Basques and Catalans being his two &lt;em&gt;Paradestücke&lt;/em&gt;. Wales, in fact, is somewhat of a paradoxical failure, given its favourable starting position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter 2, &amp;lsquo;The people of the language&amp;rsquo;, discusses the potential precursors to a stronger Welsh nationalism in early 19th century Wales, such as the &amp;lsquo;Llanover Circle&amp;rsquo;, who were strongly influenced by Herderian ideas. (Or indeed outside Wales, as in the society of Welsh clergymen of Yorkshire.) Crucially, Brooks points out, many exponents of an early form of &lt;em&gt;Landespatriotismus&lt;/em&gt; were generally conservative in their politics and Anglican in religion, rather than Liberal and Nonconformist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In chapter 3, Brooks considers the relationship between the Welsh &amp;lsquo;radical&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;liberal&amp;rsquo; tradition and the Welsh language. For Brooks, Liberal ideas of progress, &amp;lsquo;common sense&amp;rsquo; and individual rights all end up being harmful to the cause of the  language. The Liberal ideal where the general triumphs over the particular inevitably leads to a normalization of monolingualism. Welsh speakers must learn English, because that is the way to join the community of reason and progress, and refusing to do so is harmful to their own individual good. This, of course, is the ideology of the Blue Books:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Welsh language is a vast drawback to Wales and a manifold
barrier to the moral progress and commercial prosperity of the
people&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or of John Stuart Mill&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experience proves that it is possible for one nationality to merge
and be absorbed in another; and when it was originally an inferior
and more backward portion of the human race, the absorption is
greatly to its advantage. Nobody can suppose that it is not more
beneficial to a Breton, or a Basque of French Navarre, to be brought
into the current of the ideas and feelings of a highly civilized and
cultivated people—to be a member of the French nationality, admitted
on equal terms to all the privileges of French citizenship, sharing
the advantages of French protection, and the dignity and prestige of
French power—than to sulk on his own rocks, the half-savage relic of
past times, revolving in his own little mental orbit, without
participation or interest in the general movement of the world. The
same remark applies to the Welshman or the Scottish Highlander as
members of the British nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, Wales was not at all unique in this: Brooks adduces examples of &amp;lsquo;assimilationist Liberalism&amp;rsquo; from the Continent in chapter 4. He also considers some responses to this tradition, both in Europe and in Wales. Here, he comes back to the idea that since liberal politics is inimical to minorities, they had to join forces with conservatism (albeit tactically and pragmatically rather than necessarily ideologically); hence František Palacký&amp;rsquo;s refusal to support the German parliament in Frankfurt: better keep the empire that can be talked to than being guaranteed to be outvoted by a parliament. In Wales, Brooks pays particular attention to Michael D. Jones &amp;ndash; best known for his role in the Welsh colonization enterprise in Patagonia &amp;ndash; and Emrys ap Iwan, who both rejected the Liberal anti-particularist stance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In chapter 5, &amp;lsquo;How Wales can be&amp;rsquo;, Brooks sets out what he sees as the quandary of Welsh nationalism. The Welsh political tradition has a strong &amp;lsquo;radical&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;progressive&amp;rsquo; identity, first Liberal, then Labourite. Both of these traditions strongly emphasize universal values and downplay the kind of minority-community rights that underpin language revitalization. In this situation, Welsh nationalism has had relatively little space to offer a critique of this dominant narrative from the left, and hence has tended to the right, notably with Saunders Lewis. Brooks is strongly critical of &amp;lsquo;civic nationalism&amp;rsquo; (continuing a theme from &lt;em&gt;Pa beth yr aethoch&lt;/em&gt;), which inherits the emphasis on universality and individual rights, and hence perpetuates the asymmetrical power relationship between English (the &amp;lsquo;default&amp;rsquo; language of the &amp;lsquo;general&amp;rsquo; values) and Welsh. His preferred solution appears to be a discarding of assimilationist, English-inclined liberalism in favour of one where Welsh is made into the same kind of &amp;lsquo;general&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;common&amp;rsquo; language (at least in some parts of the country) that English is now across Wales. He recognizes that this requires policy solutions that are not, strictly speaking, consistent with the mainstream liberal views of &amp;lsquo;liberty&amp;rsquo; &amp;mdash; such as requiring immigrants to Welsh-speaking communities to learn Welsh (after all, Brooks points out, immigrants to the English-speaking British communities are expected, indeed often required by law, to learn English) or introducing positive discrimination measures in areas such as housing. The trade-off, however, is worth it, since the alternative is the progressive weakening of the language, which is presumably undesirable even for &amp;lsquo;civic&amp;rsquo; nationalists, given the relative weakness of a purely political Welsh identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brooks certainly does not pull his punches. It&amp;rsquo;s a highly interesting book even for someone like me who only has a fairly passing acquaintance with either the history of nationalism or relevant issues in language policy. Brooks&amp;rsquo; warning to Welsh nationalism that an uncritical embrace of the British Left means siding with what is often an unthinkingly assimilationist narrative is a challenging idea that deserves to be taken seriously (it is certainly much more nuanced than the simplistic &amp;lsquo;BritNats don&amp;rsquo;t notice they&amp;rsquo;re nationalist&amp;rsquo; smugness we&amp;rsquo;ve been recently seeing so much of). At the same time Brooks offers some tantalizing pointers showing how a left-wing perspective is not entirely incompatible with the sort of recipes he has in mind for protecting the Welsh language. One point that struck me as quite pertinent is the idea that under a liberal regime minority communities have a right to security (i.e. to not being persecuted) but not a right to survival or even growth &amp;mdash; a useful perspective for someone like me who hasn&amp;rsquo;t encountered it before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in sum, a challenging but interesting read. I teach some lectures on Celtic in our second-year &lt;em&gt;Structure and history of European languages&lt;/em&gt; course, and the few minutes I spend on Welsh sociolinguistics have so far been rather colonized by the &amp;lsquo;heroic narrative&amp;rsquo; of Welsh language survival. It strikes me that I probably have to fix this now!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Phonological Theory</title>
<link>http://anghyflawn.github.io/teaching/2015/phonological-theory/</link>
<pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
<guid>http://anghyflawn.github.io/teaching/2015/phonological-theory/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;This course introduces students to a range of important topics in (generative) phonological theory and to phonological data analysis. On the theoretical side, we will cover the following topics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basics of phonological theory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feature theory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Derivations, underlying representations, rules&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Process interaction and rule ordering&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phonological typology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suprasegmental phonology: syllable structure, stress, tone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advanced feature theory: feature geometry, unary features&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Constraints in phonology: well-formedness conditions, templates, conspiracies, the &amp;lsquo;duplication problem&amp;rsquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explanation in phonology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the course, there is a strong emphasis on building data analysis and problem solving skills. Click &lt;a href=&#34;http://anghyflawn.github.io/teaching/2014/phonological-theory/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for last year&amp;rsquo;s course handbook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following this course, students will be able to progress to advanced study of phonological theory. In &lt;sup&gt;2015&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2016&lt;/sub&gt;, we will &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be offering LASC10089 Current Issues in Phonology, but it is planned that this will run in the second semester of &lt;sup&gt;2016&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2017&lt;/sub&gt;. Get in touch early with prospective supervisors if you&amp;rsquo;re thinking about an Honours dissertation in phonology in &lt;sup&gt;2016&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2017&lt;/sub&gt;, because it is likely you&amp;rsquo;ll need to do some summer reading. Conversely, LASC10046 Historical Phonology &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; running this year, but not next year. Plan accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Teaching language in schools: beyond foreign languages</title>
<link>http://anghyflawn.github.io/blog/2015/language-in-schools/</link>
<pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
<guid>http://anghyflawn.github.io/blog/2015/language-in-schools/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.scotsman.com/news/insight-why-scots-face-a-language-barrier-1-3853275&#34;&gt;An excellent piece&lt;/a&gt; by Dani Garavelli in Scotland on Sunday on the state of modern foreign languages in Scottish schools includes a familiar litany of failings: a relatively early end of compulsory language study, staffing issues, teaching methods, differences between schools with more opportunities for pupils from more privileged backgrounds, and so on, and on, and on. One of the points strikes a bit closer to home for me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One [factor] is that our children are taught very little English
grammar. This means that when it comes to studying another language
they have to learn concepts such as tenses and verb conjugation from
scratch. “When they come into our class, they have never heard terms
like past participle,” says one ML teacher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is, I submit, a big problem, not just as far as modern languages go. The science of language should be taught in schools, as part of the English curriculum, for foreign languages, and just more generally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can quite vividly recall the shock I experienced when, as a PhD student, I tutored an Introduction to Linguistics course. Well, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t even that: at that time, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.uit.no&#34;&gt;University of Tromsø&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s courses were set up in a way where all students in the &amp;lsquo;Faculty of Humanities&amp;rsquo; (this basically meant Norwegian language &amp;amp; literature, foreign languages &amp;amp; literatures, and a few other allied subjects) had to do something called &lt;em&gt;examen facultatum&lt;/em&gt;, which was a brief introduction to all the subjects taught at the faculty, including linguistics. So the students were a mix of language-y and non-language-y types. In my first two or three tutorials I had the distinct feeling I was running full speed into a brick wall. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t that they were lazy, or weren&amp;rsquo;t trying hard, or anything like that &amp;mdash; clearly not &amp;mdash; but I was getting nowhere. And then it hit me: the very idea that the structure of language is an object of analysis was just foreign to them. This was very new to me. I went to school in Russia, where (at least way back when) some versions of phonetic, morphological and syntactic analysis are taught (and assessed) from a very early stage and throughout the school years. The way it&amp;rsquo;s done can be, and often is, dry and unenlightening, but the very concept of analysing language is not something that&amp;rsquo;s alien and new when you start university.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things seem to be quite different in Norway &amp;mdash; and, it would seem, in much of the English-speaking world as well. And that is a problem. Teaching the science of language can help with a lot, and it should not be too difficult to find interesting angles. People are fascinated by language and want to know more. Not giving them the tools and knowledge to master what can be mastered in this area is selling them short. And it can, in fact, be harmful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For one thing, people&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1357&#34;&gt;nervous cluelessness&lt;/a&gt; about language provides fertile ground to all sorts of prejudice. Consider &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.english.ox.ac.uk/about-faculty/faculty-members/language-and-linguistics/cameron-professor-deborah&#34;&gt;Deborah Cameron&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s admirable &lt;a href=&#34;https://debuk.wordpress.com/2015/07/05/just-dont-do-it/&#34;&gt;recent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://debuk.wordpress.com/2015/07/26/a-response-to-naomi-wolf/&#34;&gt;crusade&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://debuk.wordpress.com/2015/08/03/how-to-write-a-bullshit-article-about-womens-language/&#34;&gt;against&lt;/a&gt; bullshit attitudes to women&amp;rsquo;s language &amp;mdash; really just using a vaguely-plausibly-sounding factoid to clamp down on women. Of course it&amp;rsquo;s not plausible to teach schoolchildren about the intricacies of creaky voice &amp;mdash; but it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; (or should be) plausible to equip them with the knowledge that language is not something policed from above but a real phenomenon that can be analysed and talked about in scientific terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A similar story can be told with non-standard forms of speech. People tend to dismiss them as &amp;lsquo;slang&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;incorrect&amp;rsquo; versions of General English, but there is a lot of teaching that could be done on the basis of comparing pupils&amp;rsquo; native varieties with General English. It should not be too difficult to show the difference between &amp;lsquo;accent&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;dialect&amp;rsquo; using a localized version of the anecdote recounted by Joseph Wright in his &lt;a href=&#34;https://archive.org/stream/englishdialectgr00wriguoft#page/n9/mode/2up&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;English dialect grammar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (which I lifted, of course, from John Wells&amp;rsquo; &lt;em&gt;Accents of English&lt;/em&gt;): a local pronunciation of phrase in General English (in Wright, &lt;em&gt;the roads are dirty&lt;/em&gt; with a characteristic Northern English [oː] vowel) is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; standard &amp;mdash; it is General English with an &amp;lsquo;accent&amp;rsquo; &amp;mdash; but it is of course appreciably different from the &amp;lsquo;dialect&amp;rsquo; version, which Wells tentatively respells as &lt;em&gt;&amp;rsquo;t reeads is mucky&lt;/em&gt;, with phonetic (&lt;em&gt;reeads&lt;/em&gt;), lexical (&lt;em&gt;&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;mucky&lt;/em&gt;) and syntactic (with &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; following the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_subject_rule&#34;&gt;Northern Subject Rule&lt;/a&gt;) differences from General English. This is all eminently teachable, and in-depth attention to people&amp;rsquo;s native varieties can show that these varieties are just as &amp;lsquo;logical&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;rule-bound&amp;rsquo; as General English (just look at the work of linguists like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ulster.ac.uk/staff/am.henry.html&#34;&gt;Alison Henry&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/critical/staff/jennifersmith/&#34;&gt;Jennifer Smith&lt;/a&gt; to see how interesting and important these non-standard varieties can be). Instead, what we all too often get is disparagement of non-standard varieties, often with more or less overt class prejudice thrown into the mix &amp;mdash; in Scotland, it&amp;rsquo;s the slang spoken by the neds of the schemes. Or do a quick search for &amp;lsquo;fleg&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;say nahim&amp;rsquo; &amp;mdash; representations of typical lower-status pronunciations in Ulster English &amp;mdash; to see how they&amp;rsquo;re used as markers of working-class speech to satirize (overwhelmingly working-class) protesters. It might be less acceptable to say they&amp;rsquo;re trash from the estate, but to point fingers at their language counts as funny. (This often comes packaged with the oh-so-funny observation that Ulster Scots is English with a Ballymena accent &amp;mdash; although a test along the lines of Wright&amp;rsquo;s anecdote can quickly disavow this.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And on the other side of this barricade you will often find well-meaning but rather ill-informed defences along the lines of &amp;lsquo;Scots is a separate language because it&amp;rsquo;s a mixture of English and Scandinavian&amp;rsquo;. This reflects people&amp;rsquo;s interest &amp;mdash; but also the limitations of trying to find stuff out for oneself without access to the necessary background knowledge about how languages develop and change, and why &amp;lsquo;language mixture&amp;rsquo; is such an imprecise description of what&amp;rsquo;s going on here (or indeed why this kind of appeal shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be necessary to justify people&amp;rsquo;s ways of speaking). And this is the kind of stuff that should not be all that difficult to teach in schools. In Norway, schoolchildren learn about the precise differences between Norwegian dialects and about the history of the language, with a taste of Old Norse thrown into the mix, and there&amp;rsquo;s no logical reason something similar couldn&amp;rsquo;t be done here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So learning about language can help us with learning about all sorts of ways in which it functions in society, about its different forms and shapes, and about the connection between language and history. This is perhaps unsurprising: people are just interested in these sorts of things. But the thing is that it is really not helpful to talk about these uses of language &lt;em&gt;without actually understanding how the structure of language works&lt;/em&gt;. This is where I pivot back to where I started &amp;mdash; the teaching of (English) grammar. Yes, teaching grammar can help with the teaching of foreign languages (I can still remember the epiphany I had when one of my linguistics lecturers used syntactic theory to explain in one sentence when to use the strong and weak forms of German adjectives &amp;mdash; something that I otherwise tried and pretty miserably failed to memorize). But you need to understand how language works before you move on to what it does &amp;mdash; it&amp;rsquo;s the door to all of these other things. If you&amp;rsquo;re going to explain the deal with the Northern Subject Rule, you rely on knowing what number or agreement are. If you&amp;rsquo;re going to talk about creaky voice (all right, &amp;lsquo;vocal fry&amp;rsquo;), you have to have some idea of what vocal folds are. And this means this kind of stuff is useful. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be a throwback to the supposedly good old days of drumming what an adverb is into impressionable young minds &amp;mdash; indeed it &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be something different, something that allows the learner to play around and see &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; things work, show that learning about language can be fun. There are ways of doing this &amp;mdash; language is one big puzzle, and putting the pieces together doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be a matter of arduous rote learning. Have a look at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.uklo.org&#34;&gt;UK Lingustics Olympiad&lt;/a&gt; for examples of fun language puzzles &amp;mdash; this kind of thing can be done on the basis of English material as well.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bottom line? Knowledge about language is important. It&amp;rsquo;s important to help children learn foreign languages better, it&amp;rsquo;s important for them to understand why things in Standard English are the way they are, and it&amp;rsquo;s also important as a base for understanding the kinds of stuff that laypeople care about most, all the accents and dialects, &amp;lsquo;men&amp;rsquo;s&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;women&amp;rsquo;s&amp;rsquo; language, language history sort of thing. It requires a concerted effort. Knowledge about language isn&amp;rsquo;t widespread, because people assume that knowing how to speak (especially how to speak &amp;lsquo;properly&amp;rsquo;) is sufficient. It&amp;rsquo;s not part of the curriculum and it&amp;rsquo;s not part of teacher training. It&amp;rsquo;s a shame. Here in Scotland we have (false modesty aside) some cracking linguistics and English language departments, and we have students doing some absolutely brilliant work (including work on accents, dialects and social varieties of English, in Scotland and elsewhere), because they think it&amp;rsquo;s interesting, because they care about it, but (hopefully) most of all because it&amp;rsquo;s fun. So it can be done, and there&amp;rsquo;s no reason why it couldn&amp;rsquo;t be done more. We do really owe it to the children.&lt;/p&gt;
