      <description>The topic of this course is how segmental representations can help understand phonological behaviour, and in particular the link between subsegmental structure and phonological activity.
The insight that the presence of phonological structure (such as a featural specification) and its activity has a long history in phonological theory. An influential early formalization of this idea was the theory of ‘markedness’ (understood quite literally as the presence of a ‘mark’) in Prague School phonology, where it was also linked to the idea that structure was built in the context of a language’s system of contrasts.</description>

      <description>The sound patterns of the Slavic languages played a foundational role in the development of Western phonological theory. Both structuralist and generative phonology share a history (or pre-history) of close engagement with Slavic data and extensive traditions of its analysis. Despite these historical links, the approaches and results achieved in these traditions in dealing with essentially the same data can be strikingly different. Much of this divergence can be ascribed to differences in how to approach the close and complex interaction of morphology and phonology that is characteristic of Slavic languages.</description>

      <description>In 2023&amp;frasl;2024, I am fully responsible for this course. Students will build on fundamental concepts in phonology to engage with a range of intermediate and advanced topics, with a focus on the following:
 Basics of phonological theory: contrast, phonemes, allophones, alternations Feature theory Derivations, underlying representations, rules Process interaction and rule ordering  Throughout the course, there is a strong emphasis on building data analysis and problem solving skills. Teaching sessions are built around discussion of puzzles and data sets.</description>

      <description>In this course (co-taught with my colleagues Patrick Honeybone and Benjamin Molineaux) we consider a variety of issues connected to phonological change. Throughout the course, we address questions such as the following:
 How do we reconstruct the phonology of past language states? What types of phonological changes are attested? How can synchronic phonological theory assist us in the study of historical phonology? What can we learn about the human language faculty by studying historical phonology?</description>

      <guid>https://www.anghyflawn.net/teaching/2023/doe/</guid>
      <description>This course provides a detailed account of dialects of English in Britain and Ireland. It examines how these varieties differ in terms of their phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax and lexis. You will have the opportunity to look in detail at specific dialects, specifically at their linguistic features, historical origins, relations to other dialects, and the current forces which are shaping their development, from dialectological, sociolinguistic, perceptual and theoretical linguistic perspectives. Dialect and language contact, dialect levelling and new dialect formation are also explored.</description>

      <guid>https://www.anghyflawn.net/teaching/2022/sotl/</guid>
      <description>This is a new course that aims to give students the chance to build their skills in linguistic analysis and their understanding of the range of linguistic diversity, by means of sustained engagement with a range of material in the target language. Students should expect a very significant independent study component.
This course is not intended as a ‘language learning’ course aiming to build practical competence in the language. Early on in the course, students will be provided with grammatical information and pointers to resources that will allow them to begin analysing extracts of texts and/or other materials in the target language.</description>

      <description>In this course we will examine how representational explanations in phonology work, when we should consider using them in preference to others, and what kind of predictions representational theories can and cannot make. Focusing on phenomena in segmental phonology, we will consider how (whether?) representational devices such as underspecification, privativity, the contrastive hierarchy, and geometric structure can constrain our expectations regarding what a possible phonological process is, as well as how they relate to each other.</description>

      <description>This course introduces the type of changes that a language may undergo, at all levels of linguistic structure, and the theoretical frameworks that are available to discuss them. The course also looks at sociolinguistic influences on language change and the consequences of language contact including language convergence, creolisation and language death.
In 2020&amp;frasl;2021, I am conducting tutorials covering the entire range of the course’s topics.</description>

What’s Where When Why: Linguistic diversity, typology, and historical linguistics How do we approach the study of diversity and variation across languages? Why are some structures rare, and others common? Why do certain features tend to occur together?</description>

      <description>This course introduces students to a range of important topics in (generative) phonological theory and to phonological data analysis. On the theoretical side, we cover the following topics:
 Basics of phonological theory: contrast, phonemes, allophones, alternations Feature theory Derivations, underlying representations, rules Process interaction and rule ordering Suprasegmental phonology: syllable structure, stress, tone Advanced feature theory: feature geometry, unary features Explanation in phonology  Throughout the course, there is a strong emphasis on building data analysis and problem solving skills.</description>

      <description>In this course (co-taught with my colleagues Patrick Honeybone and Michael Ramsammy) we consider a variety of issues connected to phonological change. Throughout the course, we address questions such as the following:
 How do we reconstruct the phonology of past language states? What types of phonological changes are attested? How can synchronic phonological theory assist us in the study of historical phonology? What can we learn about the human language faculty by studying historical phonology?</description>

      <description>This course is an obligatory part of the pre-Honours sequence for students on the MA (Hons) degree in Gaelic and Primary Education. It will introduce students to the linguistic analysis of the Scottish Gaelic language, giving an overview of phonetics and phonology, morphology and syntax, together with consideration of key sociolinguistic principles and issues, including phenomena relating to language contact, language shift and status and corpus planning.
In 2016&amp;frasl;2017, I will teach the sections on phonetics and phonology and on language change.</description>

      <description>Приглашенный мини-курс «Фонологическая теория», Москва, ГУ-ВШЭ.
В настоящем курсе рассматриваются важнейшие вопросы фонологической теории в ее генеративном варианте. Курс состоит из пяти лекций:
Лекция 1: Архитектура фонологической теории &amp;nbsp;материалы
Тема первой лекции — устройство фонологической теории, место фонологии в теории грамматики и мотивация динамического (генеративного) подхода. В рамках современной теории фонологический модуль представляется как механизм, соотносящий фонологические объекты (множества сегментов, признаков, граничных символов и т.п.), предоставленные словарем, с другими фонологическими объектами, которые описываются в терминах того же алфавита, что и «входные данные», и интерпретируются фонетическим компонентом.</description>

This course has now been discontinued. LEL Honours students interested in these topics may look at LASC10088 Phonological Theory and/or LASC10090 Phonetics and Laboratory Phonology.</description>
