      <description>This advanced course introduces students to a variety of live research issues in phonological theory. I teach this course with my colleagues Patrick Honeybone and Michael Ramsammy. This year, I am teaching the blocks on phonological analysis with Optimality Theory (3 weeks) and issues around phonological representation and contrast (2 weeks).</description>

      <description>In this course (co-taught with my colleague Patrick Honeybone) we consider a variety of issues connected to phonological change. Throughout the course, we address questions such as the following:
 How do we reconstruct the phonology of past language states? What types of phonological changes are attested? How can synchronic phonological theory assist us in the study of historical phonology? What can we learn about the human language faculty by studying historical phonology?</description>

      <description>This course is part of the pre-Honours sequence in all LEL single Honours degrees, as well as of some joint degrees (in addition to being available as an outside course). Its main aim is to familiarize students with the study of linguistic diversity and the relationship between language typology and theory-building. In 2019&amp;frasl;2020, I am acting as the course organizer for LEL2D. I am also responsible for the entire phonology block.</description>

      <description>This course familiarizes students with the study of language contact and the role contact has played in the development of English in the British and Irish Isles from the earliest times to the 19th century. It provides some brief historical background and an introduction to historical sociolinguistics, with an emphasis on the study of language contact. Armed with this knowledge, students will be in a position to tackle issues around the role of language contact in shaping the development of English in the British and Irish Isles.</description>

      <description>This course is an obligatory part of the pre-Honours sequence for students on the MA (Hons) degree in Gaelic and Primary Education. It will introduce students to the linguistic analysis of the Scottish Gaelic language, giving an overview of phonetics and phonology, morphology and syntax, together with consideration of key sociolinguistic principles and issues, including phenomena relating to language contact, language shift and status and corpus planning.
In 2016&amp;frasl;2017, I will teach the sections on phonetics and phonology and on language change.</description>

 Basics of phonological theory Feature theory Derivations, underlying representations, rules Process interaction and rule ordering Phonological typology Suprasegmental phonology: syllable structure, stress, tone Advanced feature theory: feature geometry, unary features Constraints in phonology: well-formedness conditions, templates, conspiracies, the &amp;lsquo;duplication problem&amp;rsquo; Explanation in phonology  Throughout the course, there is a strong emphasis on building data analysis and problem solving skills.</description>

      <description>This advanced course introduces students to a variety of live research issues in phonological theory. I teach this course with my colleagues Heinz Giegerich, Patrick Honeybone, and Michael Ramsammy. In 2014&amp;frasl;2015, I cover the following topics:
 Contrast in phonology and underspecification. Modified Contrastive Specification and the use of contrastive hierarchies Feature theory: markedness, feature geometry, contrast. Diagnostics of markedness and their cross-linguistic validity Suprasegmental phonology: moraic theory; morae and sonority; onset moraicity  Materials are available on Learn.</description>

      <description>In this course (co-taught with my colleagues Patrick Honeybone and Michael Ramsammy) we consider a variety of issues connected to phonological change. Throughout the course, we address questions such as the following:
 How do we reconstruct the phonology of past language states? What types of phonological changes are attested? How can synchronic phonological theory assist us in the study of historical phonology? What can we learn about the human language faculty by studying historical phonology?</description>

      <description>This course is part of the pre-Honours sequence in all LEL single Honours degrees, as well as of some joint degrees (in addition to being available as an outside course). Its main aim is to familiarize students with the study of linguistic diversity and the relationship between language typology and theory-building. In 2014&amp;frasl;2015, I am responsible for the entire phonology block. We cover the following topics:
 Phonological typology and theory.</description>

      <description>Приглашенный мини-курс «Фонологическая теория», Москва, ГУ-ВШЭ.
В настоящем курсе рассматриваются важнейшие вопросы фонологической теории в ее генеративном варианте. Курс состоит из пяти лекций:
Лекция 1: Архитектура фонологической теории &amp;nbsp;материалы
Тема первой лекции — устройство фонологической теории, место фонологии в теории грамматики и мотивация динамического (генеративного) подхода. В рамках современной теории фонологический модуль представляется как механизм, соотносящий фонологические объекты (множества сегментов, признаков, граничных символов и т.п.), предоставленные словарем, с другими фонологическими объектами, которые описываются в терминах того же алфавита, что и «входные данные», и интерпретируются фонетическим компонентом.</description>

      <description>This course was an introduction to phonological theory and to laboratory phonology &amp;mdash; the use of phonetic evidence to answer theoretical phonological questions. I was responsible for the morphophonology portion of the course.
This course has now been discontinued. LEL Honours students interested in these topics may look at LASC10088 Phonological Theory and/or LASC10090 Phonetics and Laboratory Phonology.</description>
