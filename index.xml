<description>&lt;p&gt;The Celtic languages are characterized by an elaborate system of alternations of word-initial segments, traditionally known as ‘consonant mutations’. Although historically they arose from across-the-board phonological sandhi, they are now deeply embedded in morphosyntactic processes. They are relatively phonologically coherent, but also non-concatenative, and sensitive to a wide range of lexical, morphological, syntactic and semantic factors. As a result, Celtic mutations present an important test bed for theories of word structure and its interactions with both phonology and syntax.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Phonological Theory</title>

<guid>https://www.anghyflawn.net/teaching/2023/phonological-theory/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;sup&gt;2023&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2024&lt;/sub&gt;, I am fully responsible for this course. Students will build on fundamental concepts in phonology to engage with a range of intermediate and advanced topics, with a focus on the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basics of phonological theory: contrast, phonemes, allophones, alternations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feature theory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Derivations, underlying representations, rules&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Process interaction and rule ordering&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the course, there is a strong emphasis on building data analysis and problem solving skills. Teaching sessions are built around discussion of puzzles and data sets. Students are assessed via a semester-long project focused on describing and analysing the phonological patterns of a language of their choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This course is also offered for MSc students (as &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/23-24/dpt/cxlasc11148.htm&#34;&gt;LASC11148&lt;/a&gt;). It is suitable for postgraduate students who have had some previous exposure to phonology.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The ATR/Laryngeal connection and emergent features</title>
<link>https://www.anghyflawn.net/writing/calediad/</link>

<guid>https://www.anghyflawn.net/writing/calediad/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I consider an unusual sound change and synchronic alternation in south-eastern dialects of Welsh, traditionally referred to as ‘provection’ (Welsh &lt;em&gt;calediad&lt;/em&gt;). This phenomenon involves the ‘devoicing’ of stops following stressed vowels. I suggest that it may be the result of a typologically rare sort of vowel-consonant featural interaction, where ‘devoicing’ is triggered by tense vowels. This is unexpected typologically, since tongue root advancement — often a correlate of ‘tense’ vowel quality — is more frequently associated with voicing rather than devoicing in obstruents. I argue that in Welsh the phonologization of the quality distinction in stressed vowels has created a system where such an interaction is dispreferred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suggest that the unusual consonant-vowel interaction in south-eastern Welsh is facilitated by the phonological ambiguity of the ‘tenseness’ contrast in vowels. Although the distinction between ‘tense’ and ‘lax’ vowel pairs is made consistently in most Welsh dialects, it is often fairly inert phonologically. This makes it possible for it to become involved in a variety of phonological processes. I survey the diversity of ways in which quantity-quality interactions in vowels found across Welsh dialects, and argue that the attested multiple paths of phonologization support a bottom-up, substance-free approach to phonologization. I suggest that the particular strength of the substance-free model lies in its ability to account for different — sometimes drastically so — phonological behaviour emerging from ambiguous data.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A metrical approach to ternarity in Northern European accentual contrasts</title>
<link>https://www.anghyflawn.net/presentation/2023/30mfm/</link>
<pubDate>Mon, 02 Aug 2021 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
<guid>https://www.anghyflawn.net/presentation/2023/30mfm/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Many languages of Northern Europe possess typologically non-trivial systems of prosodic con- trasts, analysed variously as ‘tonal/pitch accent’ (North and West Germanic, Gaelic, Baltic), laryngeal accent/stød (North Germanic, Baltic, Finnic, Gaelic), and ternary quantity distinctions (Finnic, Sámi, Gaelic). In this paper, I show that despite the diversity of phonetic correlates, the fundamental structure of these systems is almost perfectly isomorphic. Specifically, they are often three-way contrasts between stressed syllables that lack the segmental material to support the accentual contrast, and two kinds of stressed syllables that do have such segmental content: one bearing some marked accentual specification and one lacking it. I argue that this generalization is especially well captured by ‘metrical’ (more specifically foot-based) analyses of tonal accents (e. g. Morén-Duolljá 2013, Köhnlein 2016, Iosad 2016, Morrison 2019).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually, the contrasts are treated as two-way distinctions with a markedness asymmetry: for instance, Danish stød is considered the marked pole of the contrast (Basbøll 2005), while the relative markedness of North Germanic tonal accents is much debated (e. g. Kristoffersen 2006). Importantly, the two-way contrasts are often neutralized in certain segmental contexts, such as in final stressed syllables (Swedish/Norwegian) or in syllables with insufficiently sonorous rhymes (Danish stød, Franconian and Baltic accents).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Borrowing a term from the Danish tradition (e. g. Grønnum &amp;amp; Basbøll 2001, cf. also Liberman 1984), I will refer to syllables that cannot support the prosodic contrasts as lacking accentual basis. In the paper, I show that different accentual systems in Northern Europe exhibit this basic ternary structure, differing primarily in how they define accentual basis, and in the mechanisms of default vs. non-default prosodification that are responsible for the contrast in syllables with basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, basis is usually defined by size: accentual contrasts can require a bimoraic high-sonority coda (Danish stød, Baltic, Franconian), a bimoraic trochaic domain (Scottish Gaelic), a bimoraic voiced domain (Livonian), or a disyllabic domain (North Germanic tonal accents, Danish short-vowel stød). This framing allows us to treat the ternary systems of languages like Estonian and Aanaar Sámi, where the relevant dimension is quantity rather than ‘accent’, within the same framework: effectively, a light stressed syllable (Estonian Q1 [ˈlinɑ] ‘flax.GEN’) is ‘too small’ to provide accentual basis, whilst heavy syllables (Q2/‘long’ [ˈlinːɑ] ‘town.GEN’ and Q3/‘overlong’ [ˈlinːnɑ] ‘town.PART’) both have sufficient moraic material to support the contrast (cf. the analysis of Estonian Q3 as ‘heavy accent’ [e.g. Hint 1997, Kuznetsova 2018]).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fundamental identity of ‘ternary quantity’ and ‘accentual contrasts’ is highlighted by cases that submit to either analysis. A notable example is Low German, variously treated as ‘tonal’/‘accentual’ (Prehn 2007, Höder 2020), showing ternary quantity distinctions (Ternes 1981, Chapman 1993), or defining accentual basis by vowel quality (Kohler 2001). A variety of cues of similar structures is also attested in Scottish Gaelic (Ternes 2006), which Morrison (2019) analyses in terms of foot structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I argue that metrical approaches such as those of Köhnlein (2016) and
Morrison (2019) provide exactly the right level of abstraction to
capture the fundamental ternary structure underlying many Northern
European accentual systems, whilst also allowing for a variety of
phonetic realizations. It is also predicted that ‘metrical’ accentual
contrasts can combine with other prosodic specifications like tone to
produce more elaborate systems: this is the case in Latvian (Krämer
forthcoming). I argue that metrical approaches are superior to
frameworks that treat lexically distinctive tones as the analytical
key to ‘accentual’ contrast (Hyman 2009, Gussenhoven &amp;amp; Peters 2019):
in particular, I suggest that ‘tonal’ approaches are unable to explain
the necessary link between size and the definition of accentual basis.
Metrical analyses, by contrast, offer an insightful and unified
framework for a range of apparently disparate phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;In this course (co-taught with my colleagues &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/homes/patrick&#34;&gt;Patrick Honeybone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.homepages.ed.ac.uk/bmolinea/&#34;&gt;Benjamin Molineaux&lt;/a&gt;) we consider a variety of issues connected to phonological change. Throughout the course, we address questions such as the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do we reconstruct the phonology of past language states?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What types of phonological changes are attested?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can synchronic phonological theory assist us in the study of historical phonology?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What can we learn about the human language faculty by studying historical phonology?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;sup&gt;2022&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2023&lt;/sub&gt;, I expect to cover the following topics :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mechanisms and types of phonological change&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phonological typology and phonological change&lt;/li&gt;

<guid>https://www.anghyflawn.net/teaching/2023/doe/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;This course provides a detailed account of dialects of English in Britain and Ireland. It examines how these varieties differ in terms of their phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax and lexis. You will have the opportunity to look in detail at specific dialects, specifically at their linguistic features, historical origins, relations to other dialects, and the current forces which are shaping their development, from dialectological, sociolinguistic, perceptual and theoretical linguistic perspectives. Dialect and language contact, dialect levelling and new dialect formation are also explored. In &lt;sup&gt;2022&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2023&lt;/sub&gt;, I teach the component on the course related to Irish English and the role of contact in the development of certain varieties of Scots and Scottish English.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;What was the sociolinguistic situation in the North Atlantic in the Viking Age and its aftermath? In the near-total absence of reliable, contemporary historical sources, enquiry into language maintenance and shift in the Northern Isles, the Hebrides, and the Irish Sea basin is a fascinating, multidisciplinary enterprise, to which Arne Kruse has made very significant contributions. In this chapter, I consider how the Western Norse vernacular of the Scandinavian settlers in much of this region was ultimately replaced by the Gaelic languages. My perspective is grounded in historical sociolinguistics: I interrogate what interplay between the sociohistorical context and specific types of contact-induced change could be expected in this region in the medieval period, and try to match these predictions against what is known about Norse-Gaelic contact.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Livssyklusmodellen for fonologiske mønster i norsk og nordisk</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;I føredraget set eg fram nokre resultat frå ei gransking av fleire fonologiske mønster i norsk (og i den breiare vestnordiske konteksten), med utgangspunkt i livssyklusmodellen for lydendring. I denne modellen skjer lydendring ved at automatisk fonetisk variasjon vert til fonetiske reglar, deretter til kategoriske fonologiske reglar og vidare til sykliske fonologiske reglar i samspel med morfologien. Eg viser korleis denne modellen kastar nytt lys over fleire velkjende mønster i norsk fonologi og morfologi, frå både strukturelle, historiske og dialektologiske standpunkt. Eg set spesielt fokus på samspelet mellom den laryngale kontrasten i klusilane og utviklinga av vokalisk kvantitet i norske dialektar og andre vestnordiske språk, og viser korleis vi kan forstå fenomen som preaspirasjon og lenisering i lys av livssyklusmodellen.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;This is a new course that aims to give students the chance to build their skills in linguistic analysis and their understanding of the range of linguistic diversity, by means of sustained engagement with a range of material in the target language. Students should expect a very significant independent study component.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This course is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; intended as a ‘language learning’ course aiming to build practical competence in the language. Early on in the course, students will be provided with grammatical information and pointers to resources that will allow them to begin analysing extracts of texts and/or other materials in the target language. Students will be expected to have prepared for the teaching sessions by analysing extracts provided beforehand: in class, we will focus on going over the analysis and discussion of relevant theoretical concepts, as well as any appropriate sociohistorical background to the material. &lt;em&gt;Structure of a Language&lt;/em&gt; is a course in the linguistics of the target language: you will use your analysis skills in concert with appropriate readings to gain a knowledge of the language&amp;rsquo;s structure and of other relevant information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For &lt;sup&gt;2022&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2023&lt;/sub&gt;, the target language is &lt;strong&gt;Ukrainian&lt;/strong&gt;. More information will appear in due course.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;sup&gt;2022&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2023&lt;/sub&gt;, I am fully responsible for this course. Students will build on fundamental concepts in phonology to engage with a range of intermediate and advanced topics, with a focus on the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basics of phonological theory: contrast, phonemes, allophones, alternations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feature theory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Derivations, underlying representations, rules&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Process interaction and rule ordering&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the course, there is a strong emphasis on building data analysis and problem solving skills. Teaching sessions are built around discussion of puzzles and data sets. Students are assessed via a semester-long project focused on describing and analysing the phonological patterns of a language of their choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This course is also offered for MSc students (as &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/22-23/dpt/cxlasc11148.htm&#34;&gt;LASC11148&lt;/a&gt;). It is suitable for postgraduate students who have had some previous exposure to phonology.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Linguistics puzzles in the university curriculum</title>
<link>https://www.anghyflawn.net/presentation/2022/lagb-workshop/</link>
<pubDate>Mon, 02 Aug 2021 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
<guid>https://www.anghyflawn.net/presentation/2022/lagb-workshop/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Self-contained linguistics puzzles (Zaliznyak 1963) are extremely well-established as a means of introducing school-age young people to linguistics, primarily via the Linguistics Olympiad movement. They are carefully curated data sets that allow the solver to discover regular patters in the structure of unfamiliar languages. Crucially, solving such puzzles generally requires no prior exposure to technical concepts, and they can be tackled only with general reasoning skills. As such, they are very well suited as a ‘gateway’ towards the field for pupils who may not otherwise have engaged with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we report the preliminary results from several years of introducing puzzles into the university curriculum. We demonstrate that they are a viable way of introducing and reinforcing key technical concepts and developing general analytical skills from a very early stage. Furthermore, we show how this effect is boosted when puzzles are tightly integrated into the curriculum and overall pedagogical approach, facilitating not only the achievement of learning outcomes at the level of the individual course/module but also the development of independent enquiry skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linguistics puzzles of the kind we are using show some overlap with activities aligned to two general pedagogical approaches, namely problem-based learning and self-directed learning. For instance, like problem-based learning, they focus on developing generic skills needed to solve problems, and on creating a knowledge base of key concepts in linguistics. However, unlike standard problem-based learning, the puzzles we use are not open-ended\dash they do have a unique solution. On the other hand, as is the case in self-directed learning, they do provide an appropriate scaffold for further instruction on the topic. Our activities align further with problem-based learning in terms of problem design, in that our aim is to create a puzzle which is appropriately difficult, but also engaging to a range of learners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we report on the introduction of a ‘puzzle component’ into a first-year &lt;em&gt;ab initio&lt;/em&gt; linguistics course that is taken both by students pursuing linguistics degrees and by ‘outside’ students who choose it as an option. In this context, the puzzle component runs ‘alongside’ the core curriculum, with students having the opportunity to work on one or more new puzzles every week, without the expectation that the problems they solve relate to any specific part of the curriculum. Based on a student survey offered to five cohorts of students who have taken this course after the introduction of the component, we report both quantitative and qualitative data suggesting very high levels of satisfaction and effectiveness: importantly, students do not just find the puzzles enjoyable, but also report that, in retrospect, they found them to be useful as a means to both reinforce linguistic concepts and build more generally applicable reasoning and problem-solving skills. However, we also identify some pedagogical challenges that we have faced, in particular the difficulty of managing student expectation around the appropriate levels of support for these activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second challenge uncovered by this project concerns the relationship between puzzles and the specific curricular context of the course. We consider this in more detail by reporting a second project in which we rebuilt the pedagogy of a large ($\approx$140 students) upper beginner/lower intermediate course around puzzle solving, as a key element of adapting course delivery during the Covid-19 crisis. The course in question involves primarily technical analysis of linguistic structure. As part of this effort, we were able to maintain the technical content of the course effectively unchanged whilst re-centring our pedagogy around student-led enquiry and problem-based learning, leading to good academic outcomes coupled with high levels of satisfaction. We suggest that this success speaks to the issue of curricular integration, and argue that problem-based learning is an effective avenue to better achievement and more authentic pedagogy in linguistics.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Den historiske utviklinga til preaspirasjon i samiske språk</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;Preaspiration of voiceless stops is a well-known feature of the phonological systems of the Sámi languages,as in Northern Sámi [jahki] &lt;em&gt;jahki&lt;/em&gt; ‘year’. In some form, it is found in all Sámi varieties that we have records of, with the sole exception of Inari Sámi. We also possess a good understanding of how Sámi preaspiration is related to the consonant gradation systems of other Uralic languages, in particular those of the Finnic varieties. Present-day Sámi languages differ somewhat in the role that preaspirated stops play in their phonological systems. In this paper I outline how this variation arose in the course of the historicaldevelopment from Proto-Sámi to the present-day languages. I propose a scenario grounded in the life cycle of phonological processes (Kiparsky 1995, Bermúdez-Otero 2007, 2015). I argue that this framework is especially well suited to clarifying diverse developments of phonetic and phonological patterns from acommon historical source, and is applicable also to Sámi material. I justify this approach by tracing the development of preaspiration from a phonetic rule of Proto-Sámi to the various outcomes attested in the present-day languages.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>What did representations ever do for us?</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;In this course we will examine how representational explanations in phonology work, when we should consider using them in preference to others, and what kind of predictions representational theories can and cannot make. Focusing on phenomena in segmental phonology, we will consider how (whether?) representational devices such as underspecification, privativity, the contrastive hierarchy, and geometric structure can constrain our expectations regarding what a possible phonological process is, as well as how they relate to each other. Our main focus will be on what kind of data can motivate us to adopt a representational solution. We will consider both mainstream substance-based views of representation in the SPE tradition and various substance-free approaches to feature theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The course will be quite practical, with a focus on hands-on discussion of curated data sets. This course is most suitable for attendees who already have a grasp of how to construct a basic phonological analysis. As such, there is no set reading, but a familiarity with analysis techniques will be assumed that can be gained by at least a cursory examination of a textbook in generative phonological analysis, insofar as it covers underlying and surface representations, rules and rule ordering, and a basic introduction to phonological features.&lt;/p&gt;
