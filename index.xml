<title>English epenthesis in lC and rC clusters</title>
<link>http://anghyflawn.github.io/presentation/2018/icehl/</link>

<description>&lt;p&gt;The insertion of an unstressed vowel in &lt;em&gt;lC&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;rC&lt;/em&gt; clusters of non-rising sonority (&lt;em&gt;fil[ə]m&lt;/em&gt;), is widely known as characteristic of Irish English. It is frequently cited as a substrate feature carried over from Irish, where this process is productive (Ní Chiosáin 1999), as it is in the related Scottish Gaelic. However, this feature is also known from Older Scots, modern Scots dialects (Maguire 2017), and traditional varieties of English. Therefore, it might be an areal effect in the British and Irish Isles; notably, a similar phenomenon is also attested in Welsh (e. g. Schumacher 2011, Iosad 2017)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We reconsider whether areality best explains the prevalence of epenthesis in English. Epenthesis in various rC and lC clusters recurs throughout the history of English: Luick (1914) identifies two separate sound changes involving this epenthesis in Old English, with a third one in Middle English (Jordan 1934), all with different trigger contexts and patterns of quality of the epenthetic vowel. In fact, epenthesis in such clusters is extremely common across West Germanic (cf. Howell &amp;amp; Somers Wicka 2007): it is attested in Old High German (Reutercrona 1920, Braune 2004) and retained in Middle High German (Michels 1979) and many modern dialects (Schirmunski 1962); in Old, Middle, and Modern Dutch (van Loey 1976, Warner et al. 2001), and in Frisian (Steller 1928, Visser 2017). Epenthesis appears rarely in ancient North Germanic, but is widely attested at least in Danish dialects (Hansen 1962). Common to Germanic epenthesis patterns are a diversity of affected clusters and qualities of inserted vowel, a lack of regularity of epenthesis as a sound change, and erosion over time due to syncope processes targeting both epenthetic and original vowels. This makes it clear they cannot all be inherited from a single sound change in the protolanguage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We argue that parallel developments of post-sonorant epenthesis across (at least West) Germanic represent an instance of drift arising from variation at an earlier stage (e. g. Joseph 2013). The recurring epenthesis ‘events’ are not separate, but instead are best seen as attestations of a variable phenomenon always present to some extent in the West Germanic languages. This makes them distinct from exceptionless excrescence, which arises from retiming of vocalic gestures (Hall 2006), as attested in Scottish Gaelic and in the Sámi languages. We argue that these differences undermine the case for epenthesis as an areal feature in the British and Irish Isles.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>The influence of Norse on Scottish Gaelic, 85 years on</title>
<link>http://anghyflawn.github.io/presentation/2018/frlsu/</link>
<pubDate>Mon, 04 Jun 2018 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
<guid>http://anghyflawn.github.io/presentation/2018/frlsu/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In this paper I propose (yet another) reappraisal of the arguments
regarding the relationship between Norse and Gaelic in the North
Atlantic world, focusing on the development of preaspiration. There is
significant controversy in the literature as to whether this feature,
along with others such as tonal accent, represents Norse influence on
Gaelic (e.g. Marstrander 1932; Borgstrøm 1974; Gunnar Ólafur Hansson
2001), an independent development in Gaelic (e.g. Ó Baoill 1980; Ó
Murchú 1985; Ó Maolalaigh 2010), or even Gaelic influence on Norse
(McKenna 2013). With recent advances in our understanding of how the
social context of contact influences its linguistic outcomes (e.g.
Thomason &amp;amp; Kaufman 1988; Trudgill 2011; Millar 2016), the debate around
the role of language contact in the development of Gaelic varieties has
begun to acquire a more solid theoretical underpinning; see in
particular Stewart (2004); Lindqvist (2015) and most recently Lewin
(2017).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I offer an account of the development of preaspiration combining these
sociolinguistic insights with the theory of the life cycle of
phonological processes (e.g. Bermúdez-Otero 2007; 2015; Bermúdez-Otero &amp;amp;
Trousdale 2012). I argue that this theory offers a useful diagnostic for
historical language contact, since discontinuities in the life cycle can
only be contact-induced. I propose a model of the development of Gaelic
preaspiration consistent with the life cycle model, starting with
variable preaspiration, arguing that variable preaspiration is a
pan-Gaelic phenomenon under-reported in traditional sources. Under this
analysis, the rise of categorical preaspiration is a Northern Gaelic
innovation (cf. Clayton 2010), centred on Argyll. With this linguistic
argument in hand, I argue that a Norse origin for this feature is
unlikely to be compatible with what we know about the sociolinguistic
context of the (re-)Gaelicization of Argyll (Jennings &amp;amp; Kruse (2009a);
(2009b); Clancy (2011); Whyte (2017), &lt;em&gt;pace&lt;/em&gt; Macniven (2015)).&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A metrical analysis of Scottish Gaelic tonal accent</title>
<link>http://anghyflawn.github.io/presentation/2018/rnag/</link>
<pubDate>Thu, 12 Apr 2018 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
<guid>http://anghyflawn.github.io/presentation/2018/rnag/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I provide a new analysis of the ‘tonal accent’ opposition in Gaelic, conceptualizing it as involving lexically specified metrical — in particular foot — structure. As discussed among others by Ternes (1980, 2006), many Gaelic varieties use suprasegmental features such as pitch (e.g. Lewis, Wester Ross) or glottalization (e.g. Jura, Colonsay) to make two kinds of distinctions: disyllabic hiatus vs. heavy syllables (&lt;em&gt;àth&lt;/em&gt; vs. &lt;em&gt;atha&lt;/em&gt;); and disyllabic vs. svarabhakti words (&lt;em&gt;balg&lt;/em&gt; vs. &lt;em&gt;balach&lt;/em&gt;). Ternes rightly compares these patterns with tonal accent systems in Germanic, and postulates lexical tone as the key distinction between the two ‘accents’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non-tonal analyses have been proposed by authors such as Bosch &amp;amp; de Jong (1997); Smith (1999); Brown (2009); Iosad (2015). In particular, Smith and Iosad offer analyses where the svarabhakti vowel in words like balg is metrically invisible, with consequences for the patterning of tone and glottalization. However, this analysis can only work if svarabhakti vowels are fully predictable synchronically. In this simple form, the analysis is untenable: svarabhakti vowels may be absent in contexts where they are phonologically motivated (e.g. [x] representing preaspiration of [k] does not trigger svarabhakti &lt;em&gt;olc&lt;/em&gt; [ɔɫxk], *[ɔɫɔxk]), and conversely svarabhakti-related suprasegmental patterns can appear when they are synchronically unmotivated (e.g. [faɫa.i], [mara.i] with ‘monosyllabic’ accent for &lt;em&gt;falbhaidh&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;marbhaidh&lt;/em&gt;). Similar counterexampels can be adduced for glottalization: compare [marəv] for marbh with svarabhakti-induced lack of glottalization but [marɪç] &lt;em&gt;marbhaidh&lt;/em&gt; where the lack of [ʔ] cannot be so explained. Building on recent work in the analysis of tonal accents (e.g. Morén-Duolljá 2013, Köhnlein 2016, Iosad 2016, Kehrein 2017), in this paper I show how these problems can be resolved if both glottalization and tonal accents in Scottish Gaelic are analysed using lexically pre-specified foot structure.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>There is no problem of /v/ in Russian phonology</title>
<link>http://anghyflawn.github.io/presentation/2018/26mfm/</link>
<pubDate>Thu, 12 Apr 2018 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
<guid>http://anghyflawn.github.io/presentation/2018/26mfm/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;The dual behaviour of /v/ has been a notorious crux in Russian phonology since at least Jakobson (1956). The basic problem is that /v/ fails to trigger voicing assimilation, like sonorants, but undergoes both assimilation to following obstruents  and final devoicing, like obstruents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commonest solution in the literature is representational: [v] is treated as a sonorant, either an underlying /w/ (Lightner 1972, Hayes 1984, Kiparsky 1985) or some labial non-glide (Coats &amp;amp; Harshenin 1971, Padgett 2002). Most recently, Reiss (2017) analyses /v/ as /V/, underspecified for [±voice] – patterning with sonorants, but not a sonorant in featural terms – that is devoiced to [f]. He argues that this is an insurmountable challenge to the Contrastivist Hypothesis (Hall 2007), since [v] and [f] are minimally distinct in terms of voicing, but do not pattern phonologically like other similar pairs in Russian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The argument rests on two premises: Russian /v/ lacks a voicing specification, and is thus unable to trigger assimilation (cf. Kiparsky 1985, Hall 2004), but becomes phonologically voiceless in the course of the derivation. In this paper I argue that the first premise is correct, but there is no evidence that the latter process is phonological; instead, there is every reason to treat all (de)voicing patterns affecting Russian /v/ as belonging to the phonetic component, just as is the case for sonorants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under this analysis, the apparent serial interaction of the obstruentization of /v/ and its devoicing follows from the feed-forward architecture of grammar, not from ordering within the phonology (for a related analysis, see Knyazev 2004, 2006). I argue that Russian /v/ is laryngeally underspecified not just in the input to phonology but also in its output; it is in no sense the voiced counterpart of /f/, which joins the better known [t͡s], [t͡ʃʲ], and [x] in lacking such a counterpart (cf. already Kiparsky 1985). If the patterns of /v/ (de)voicing are phonetic, then a whole host of facts cease to be problematic for phonological analysis, including the famous variability in the behaviour of devoiced /v/ as an assimilation trigger ([jazf] ∼ [jasf] for /jazv/ ‘sore.GEN.PL’; Reformatskiĭ 1975); the behaviour of [v] and sonorants in voicing assimilation (Kulikov 2013); the fact that some (de)voicing patterns are specific to [v], such as the minority but robust pattern of progressive assimilation in [v#v] sequences (Vorontsova 2007); and the sensitivity of sonorant and /v/ (de)voicing to prosodic boundary strength.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dissociation between laryngeal assimilation in obstruents and in /v/ is also expected to follow from the life cycle of phonological processes (Bermúdez-Otero 2015): historically, the former predates the latter by several centuries, and there is ample dialect evidence showing that the devoicing of /v/, even where it did happen, did not always result in [f], [x] being a frequent outcome (e. g. Kasatkin 2005, Galinskaya 2008). The proposed analysis is reminiscent of ‘rule scattering’ (Zsiga 2000, Bermúdez- Otero 2015), with both phonological and phonetic patterns of (de)voicing found in the same language; in fact, I argue that phonetic /v/ (de)voicing coexists with another phonetic pattern of obstruent devoicing and assimilation – the gradient congener of phonological assimilation rules arising via rule scattering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, many aspects of the behaviour of Russian [v] may have a phonetic rationale, at least historically (albeit possibly not synchronically, as argued by Bjorndahl 2015). However, in this paper I argue that the best analysis of the problem of /v/ is a substance-free one that does not encode these explanations in the phonological grammar, contra e. g. Padgett (2002), but also respects the privileged role of contrast in phonological representation, contra Reiss (2017).&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Optimality Theory: Motivations and perspectives</title>
<link>http://anghyflawn.github.io/writing/ot-handbook/</link>
<pubDate>Fri, 12 Jan 2018 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
<guid>http://anghyflawn.github.io/writing/ot-handbook/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;This chapter provides an introduction to the basic mechanisms of Optimality Theory in phonology and to the most important motivations cited for its widespread adoption. I also review some of the empirical and conceptual challenges it has faced. Ultimately, I suggest, many of these challenges can be traced back to the fact that while OT grew out of a general dissatisfaction with some aspects of late-1980s rule-based phonology, it was adopted as a general theory of phonological computation without an explicit statement of the division of labour vis-à-vis other components of linguistic knowledge with which it interacts. I conclude the chapter by a discussion of ways in which OT still remains relevant even within a changed phonological landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Norwegian preaspiration in traditional and modern sources</title>
<link>http://anghyflawn.github.io/presentation/2018/fgls/</link>
<pubDate>Sat, 09 Dec 2017 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
<guid>http://anghyflawn.github.io/presentation/2018/fgls/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;In this paper I survey traditional descriptions of Norwegian dialects
with particular attention to their discussion of voiceless stop
preaspiration, and conclude that it is highly probable preaspiration has
been consistently under-reported in these sources. As surveyed in detail
by Pétur Helgason (2002), preaspiration in Norwegian has been reported
most prominently for northern Gudbrandsdalen (Ross 1907; Horne 1917),
Rogaland (Oftedal 1947; Wolter 1965), and for Senja by Iversen (1913).
To Helgason’s list should be added Vestvågøya (Elstad 1982) and contact
varieties in Northern Norway (Jahr 2008). Other varieties, by
implication, lack preaspiration, and it is usually treated as
characteristic of most mainland North Germanic varieties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I survey the results of recent empirical studies. Pétur Helgason
(2002) has shown that preaspiration is widespread in mainland
varieties; in particular, he has demonstrated that it is pervasive,
albeit variable, in Central Standard Swedish. Preaspiration has also
been shown to exist in Trøndelag (Moxness 1998; van Dommelen 1998; van
Dommelen, Holm &amp;amp; Koreman 2011; Ringen &amp;amp; van Dommelen 2013), Dalane
(Tengesdal 2015), and Oslo (Allen 2016). Finally, I briefly present
the results of my own instrumental study demonstrating the
pervasiveness of preaspiration in speakers from both Rogaland and
Northern Norway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I argue that this situation is less likely to be due to language change,
and more likely to reflect fieldworkers’ lack of expectation to find
preaspiration: for instance, Elstad (1982) notes preaspiration for
Vestvågøya where Christiansen (1933) does not mention it for the
neighbouring island of Gimsøya; Tengesdal (2015) directly contradicts
Oftedal’s (1947) impressionistic claims — even though the same author
correctly identified preaspiration in Scottish Gaelic (Oftedal 1956). I
compare these findings to the recent discussion by Kristoffersen (2016)
of the late discovery of the lack of tonal contrasts in rural dialects
around Bergen.&lt;/p&gt;

Throughout the course, we address questions such as the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do we reconstruct the phonology of past language states?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What types of phonological changes are attested?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can synchronic phonological theory assist us in the study of historical phonology?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What can we learn about the human language faculty by studying historical phonology?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;sup&gt;2017&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2018&lt;/sub&gt;, I will cover the following topics (subject to change with extreme prejudice):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mechanisms and types of phonological change&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phonological typology and phonological change&lt;/li&gt;

<title>Towards a history of the tenseness contrast in Brythonic vowels</title>
<link>http://anghyflawn.github.io/presentation/2017/esohph3/</link>
<pubDate>Fri, 01 Sep 2017 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
<guid>http://anghyflawn.github.io/presentation/2017/esohph3/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Modern Welsh is similar to many modern Germanic languages such as English, German and Dutch in showing an association between &amp;lsquo;tense&amp;rsquo; vowel quality and phonological length. Specifically, long vowels tend to be tense in quality and short vowels tend to be lax, with concomitant alternations. As in the Germanic case, there is some disagreement in the literature on whether quality or quantity (or both) is phonologically relevant in Modern Welsh. In this paper I aim to add to this debate via an overview of the diatopic variation in the relationship between vowel quantity and quality in Welsh and more broadly in the Brythonic languages. I argue that tense/lax quality is likely to be diachronically secondary with respect to quantity, being derivable from prosodic contexts &amp;mdash; primarily vowel length and syllable structure. One of the notable consequences of this is that even when tense/lax quality has been phonologized (as in, for instance, south-western dialects of Welsh), it is still partly conditioned by quantity and syllable structure; conversely, the distribution of quantity is not significantly determined by vowel quality, which supports the contention that quantity is synchronically active in Welsh phonology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To support this case for a secondary development of tense/lax quality, I offer a reconstruction of its rise that starts with a tensing of word-final stressed vowels, perhaps initially only restricted to high vowels. This later undergoes rule generalization  to embrace both non-high vowels (as in most dialects with tense [e: oː]) and to syllable-final rather than word-final position (as in South Welsh dialects, where long vowels are allowed in penultimate stressed syllables). I show that intermediate stages of this development are attested across modern Welsh dialects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I argue that the Brythonic languages present an interesting test case for theories that attempt to connect the &amp;lsquo;transphonologization&amp;rsquo; of quantity as quality with the rise of vowel shifts: despite the long/short vowels undergoing a tense/lax split, much as in many Germanic languages, the Brythonic system neither became prone to vowel shifting (as in the case of English) nor underwent a further split where the new qualities fit into a new quantity system (as in many North Germanic varieties).&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Pre-sonorant voicing and language contact</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;I draw attention to the fact that whilst pre-sonorant voicing of &lt;em&gt;fricatives&lt;/em&gt; across a word boundary appears to be fairly widely spread (at least in Europe), pre-sonorant voicing of &lt;em&gt;all obstruents&lt;/em&gt; appears to cluster in areas where &amp;lsquo;aspirating&amp;rsquo; languages are in contact with &amp;lsquo;voice&amp;rsquo; languages: the languages involved are Breton (Celtic/Gallo-Romance), Franconian/Netherlandic (e.g. Limburg Dutch, Luxembourgish), Western Polish and Slovak (Slavic/Germanic).&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Language is only as divisive as you make it</title>
<link>http://anghyflawn.github.io/blog/2017/language-divisive-as-you-make-it/</link>
<pubDate>Tue, 31 Oct 2017 09:50:48 UTC</pubDate>
<guid>http://anghyflawn.github.io/blog/2017/language-divisive-as-you-make-it/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;It gives me no pleasure but the recent &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/language-is-an-important-but-divisive-force-k5prqm9ff&#34;&gt;opinion&lt;/a&gt; in The Times by the highly respected journalist Magnus Linklater really deserves a response. In a handy 899 words, it shows all the blind spots of a majority establishment that simply does not see what the deal is with minority languages. I can see where this position is coming from (Russia is not the most progressive country for awareness of its minority languages among the majority population), but really, one expects better &amp;mdash; not just as far as the policy  proposals go (we can surely disagree on that) but even in terms of basic journalism. The piece is full of inaccuracies that may not matter much for the central point, but boy do they get in the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it would be desperately sad to lose such an important part of our
heritage. I remember summer holidays in Ullapool and Mallaig, where
the herring were being packed in barrels by women who spoke to each
other entirely in Gaelic - as pure as you could get. The herring are
long gone. I hope the Gaelic survives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well that&amp;rsquo;s awfully nice. But note that we&amp;rsquo;re already slipping into the trope of non-modernity. Not only is Gaelic associated primarily with a traditional industry but it is also described as &amp;lsquo;pure&amp;rsquo;. When was the last time you heard someone&amp;rsquo;s English described as &amp;lsquo;pure&amp;rsquo;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t let&amp;rsquo;s pretend, however, that it is our second language. For
all the street signs, station names and border posts translated
laboriously into Gaelic&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another trope. &amp;lsquo;All&amp;rsquo; the street signs? &amp;lsquo;Laboriously&amp;rsquo; translated? This makes it sound like some sort of heroic enterprise whereby there are forests of signs going up all over Scotland. In Edinburgh, I am aware of precisely zero bilingual street signs. The number of &amp;lsquo;border posts&amp;rsquo; can&amp;rsquo;t possibly be that large. Nor, in the grand scheme of things, is the cost of renewing some station signs (lots of them, incidentally, in the Highlands).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or the £30 million spent annually on promoting it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ah yes, let&amp;rsquo;s put a price on it. How much on promoting English? How much of this money is spent on education and would therefore be spent in the English-medium education system anyway? We&amp;rsquo;re not told.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we are no more a bilingual nation than Cornwall or the Isle of Man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose at least someone in Cornwall or the Isle of Man might take exception to that, but we can let that pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an attempt to reverse that decline, the 2005 Gaelic Language Act,
which gave Gaelic formal recognition in Scotland, laid down that it
should command &amp;ldquo;equal respect&amp;rdquo; with English but stopped well short
of insisting on its use&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, &amp;lsquo;equal respect&amp;rsquo; is a largely symbolic policy with not much in the way of real teeth to enforce it if it is not complied with. This is 100% true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just take a look at Catalonia, where since the early 1980s the
&amp;ldquo;immersion&amp;rdquo; system in schools has transformed Catalan from an
archaic Latin-based tongue, once suppressed by Franco, into the
official language of the nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is so confused one doesn&amp;rsquo;t know where to start. Immersion education has, in principle, nothing to do with &amp;lsquo;official&amp;rsquo; status. Immersion is meant to produce more speakers &amp;mdash; this is what we do in Scotland without Gaelic being the &amp;lsquo;official language of the nation&amp;rsquo;. The rhetorical contrast between &amp;lsquo;archaic Latin-based tongue&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;official&amp;rsquo; language of the nation makes no sense. Why bring in &amp;lsquo;Latin-based&amp;rsquo; at all &amp;mdash; after all the majority language in the Catalan situation is the equally &amp;lsquo;Latin-based&amp;rsquo; Spanish. And note the non-modernity trope again &amp;mdash; how is Catalan &amp;lsquo;archaic&amp;rsquo;? (On the scale of how much it has changed from Latin it is roughly at the same stage as Spanish, somewhere in the middle between Sardinian and French, but it&amp;rsquo;s still difficult to see what this has to do with anything.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a consequence it has become a divisive force. For those who want to stay part of Spain, it is the language of nationalism and separation; for those who back independence, it is simply the expression of who they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here we come to the nub and the ground zero of projection. Here&amp;rsquo;s the thing: people speak a language because it&amp;rsquo;s central to who they are, or who they want to be, and there is absolutely no logical necessity that it should align to constitutional preferences. There are Spanish-speaking nationalists, and there are Catalan-speaking unionists. Minority languages are not spoken to spite the unionist majority. To say that Catalan was made divisive by immersion education feeding young nationalists, in the same breath as noting it was suppressed by Franco, honestly beggars belief. To blame the people who fought for the right to be educated, and live their lives through their own language, a right that was denied to them, for being divisive, betrays an unwillingness to step away from the majority&amp;rsquo;s view of minorities as a needy nuisance. It would be equally naive, of course, to say that the Catalan language question is completely politics-free, but here we are putting the blame squarely on the minority and not on a state with previous form for less enlightened attitudes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pressure to preserve a language is, of course, a strong one. There are those who argue that unless Gaelic is given official status it will be lost. They point to Wales, where the Welsh Language Measure of 2011 made it de jure the language of the state - the only part of the UK where English is not the principal language of government. Even here, however, the percentage of those speaking Welsh has dropped below the 20 per cent level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that is the point. The reason the Welsh Language Measure was introduced was that previous Welsh Language Acts, whilst fairly successful in many respects, particularly within education, the arts and the official sphere, were not sufficient to build many robust Welsh-language arenas, for instance in the private sector. This is exactly why Wales has moved to a language commissioner model, whose intent is to make sure Welsh-language provision can be expanded beyond areas directly funded by the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaelic, by contrast, has been in decline for far longer, and has
never been truly the language of the establishment; the writer Allan
Massie argues that the last king of Scotland to have spoken Gaelic
was James IV in the 16th century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is telling that Allan Massie (with all due respect), and not, say,
Charles Withers is the principal authority on the history of Gaelic,
but the important thing rhetorically is that again the case for Gaelic
is connected to the pre-modern past. Literally no-one serious is
basing proposals for a stronger Gaelic policy on how long it survived
as the language of the Scottish court. The reason stronger statutory
protection for Gaelic is needed is that it represents best practice in
building sustainable minority language communities, not that James IV
spoke it. This is a straw man and a continuation of unfortunate
framing of the language as irrelevant in the modern age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeking to elevate its status would, therefore, be to reverse a
 centuries-long trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &amp;lsquo;trend&amp;rsquo; being, of course, often the result of quite deliberate
government policy. But let&amp;rsquo;s not mention government policy, shall we?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finland, once part of the Swedish empire, framed its laws in
Swedish, and Finns spoke it as the national language, even after
their country was annexed by Russia in 1809.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not obvious what it means that the Finns &amp;lsquo;spoke it as the
national language&amp;rsquo;. Yes, educated citizens of the Grand Duchy of
Finland routinely read, wrote and spoke Swedish, but Finnish was also
there, wasn&amp;rsquo;t it? The words &amp;lsquo;national language&amp;rsquo; are doing a lot of
work here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, after independence in 1917, the Finnish language, whose
origins go back to the Magyar empire of the middle ages&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is so wrong it&amp;rsquo;s good. Yes, Finnish is (distantly) related to
Hungarian but the Magyar settlement of Pannonia has absolutely nothing
to do with Finland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and which was once used mainly in rural areas, gradually gained the
ascendancy and today, on the centenary of independence, has become
the language of the majority with barely 5 per cent speaking Swedish
for preference. Even here, however, language has its tensions. Try
going into a shop in rural Finland and speaking Swedish: you may get
a dusty response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The majority in Finland always spoke Finnish &amp;mdash; it&amp;rsquo;s just that the
elite stopped being exclusively Swedish-speaking. (Also, I wonder if
the &amp;lsquo;dusty&amp;rsquo; response has to do with people&amp;rsquo;s command of a language
they learn at school but don&amp;rsquo;t use much, rather than divisive
nationalist politics?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How then can Gaelic be saved? Probably by making it a vital part of
our education system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is exactly what Ireland and Wales and many other places have been
doing. And we know that it&amp;rsquo;s very important, but we also &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; that
it&amp;rsquo;s not enough. Education is vital, but providing a sphere for the
language beyond the school is more vital still. This is exactly why
Wales has been trying to push for a more assertive language policy.
This is why when you visit Catalonia or the Basque Country and see the
bilingual (trilingual, even) signs literally everywhere and not just
on the odd railway station, you see just how much stronger their
language policies are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the unchanged Scottish state system flatlining at best, those
schools teaching Gaelic are often better resourced,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no evidence for this. Certainly, none is given. Generally,
this seems to be a meme among opponents of Gaelic-medium education.
(In Edinburgh, this seems to be fuelled by the fact that GME at
secondary level is offered at the desirable James Gillespie&amp;rsquo;s High
School &amp;mdash; largely by virtue of the fact that before the opening of
the dedicated school the Gaelic-medium primary unit was at Tollcross
Primary, which feeds into JGHS, meaning that&amp;rsquo;s where the expertise
is.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;give pupils the extra dimension of a second language and provide
greater stimulation than the relatively unchallenging Curriculum for
Excellence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without getting into a scrap over education policy, which is something
I&amp;rsquo;m not competent to do, Gaelic-medium education in Scotland offers
the Curriculum for Excellence, except it&amp;rsquo;s in Gaelic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gaelic they have been taught may indeed have been &amp;ldquo;broken&amp;rdquo; by
modern jargon, but those who have learnt it will have become
familiar with the lilting quality and romantic poetry of a language
once spoken by the bards and a part of culture that enriched
Scotland&amp;rsquo;s life and heritage. Better by far to have absorbed a
language at source than that the state should try to force it onto
the statute books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And once again the pre-modern framing. Do you ever hear Coleridge and Milton referred to as a justification for the massive support the government gives to English, by teaching it at schools, supporting the arts, funding a broadcaster? No. Do you ever hear that we should all be learning English because it&amp;rsquo;s the language of international commerce? That&amp;rsquo;s preposterous. English is taught and supported because it is the language of its speakers, and that is justification enough. So why is it not enough for Gaelic?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But most perniciously, the sweet words about &amp;lsquo;lilting quality&amp;rsquo; and bards are just an excuse to say &amp;lsquo;the burden of reviving the language is on the speakers&amp;rsquo;. It is on them to come through the school and keep using their Gaelic, as we keep it off the statute books. &amp;lsquo;We&amp;rsquo;, the majority, don&amp;rsquo;t need to do anything, need suffer no inconvenience, not even the indignity of seeing a railway station sign. How are people meant to keep using their Gaelic outside of their own circle when the state offers no protection, no support for it? We&amp;rsquo;re not told. And when the small numbers of speakers give up, dwindle further in the monolingual sea of the modern nation-state, we shrug our shoulders and say &amp;lsquo;it&amp;rsquo;s a centuries-long trend; should&amp;rsquo;ve taken better care of it, really&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can, and should, do better.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Phonological Theory</title>
<link>http://anghyflawn.github.io/teaching/2017/phonological-theory/</link>

<guid>http://anghyflawn.github.io/teaching/2017/phonological-theory/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;This course introduces students to a range of important topics in (generative) phonological theory and to phonological data analysis. On the theoretical side, we cover the following topics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basics of phonological theory: contrast, phonemes, allophones, alternations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feature theory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Derivations, underlying representations, rules&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Process interaction and rule ordering&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suprasegmental phonology: syllable structure, stress, tone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advanced feature theory: feature geometry, unary features&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explanation in phonology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the course, there is a strong emphasis on building data analysis and problem solving skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This course is also offered for MSc students (as &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/17-18/dpt/cxlasc11148.htm&#34;&gt;LASC11148&lt;/a&gt;). It is suitable for postgraduate students who have had some previous exposure to phonology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following this course, students will be able to progress to advanced study of phonological theory. In &lt;sup&gt;2017&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2018&lt;/sub&gt;, we are offering both LASC10089 Current Issues in Phonology and LASC10046 Historical Phonology.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Phonology in the Soviet Union</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;This invited contribution to a collection on the history of phonology explores the history of phonological studies in the USSR. I offer a short history of phonology in Russia and the USSR before the formation of the two main theoretical currents (the &amp;lsquo;Leningrad&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Moscow&amp;rsquo; schools), and emphasize both their mutual common roots and their closeness to other structuralist frameworks, in particular Prague phonology. I discuss the differences between the two schools both in their approach to the phoneme and in their analysis of morphophonological alternations. Throughout, the focus is on the ways in which a focus on Russian shaped the directions of phonological thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Bridging the gap</title>
<link>http://anghyflawn.github.io/presentation/2017/dias/</link>

<description>&lt;p&gt;I focus on reconstructing the development of vowel quality distinctions
in Brythonic and their connection with the history of vowel quantity
between the establishment of the ‘standard’ Brythonic penultimate-stress
system and the present day. In the received picture of Modern Welsh
phonology, ‘tense’ quality of non-low vowels ([i u e o]) is strongly
associated with length and, conversely, ‘lax’ quality ([ɪ ʊ ɛ ɔ]) is
associated with shortness, at least in contrastive, i.e.stressed,
position. The history of this pattern, however, remains understudied.
Some important questions that remain to be addressed are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When and how did contrastive length in penultimate syllables
(characteristic of South Welsh, Cornish and most of Breton) become
established? Is it original (and thus preserved following the stress
shift), or does it represent a secondary lengthening of vowels that
had been shortened in unstressed position? What is the position of
North Welsh with its exclusively short vowels in stressed penults
(cf. Wmffre 2003)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, does the tense/lax quality of vowels in Welsh reflect
tense/lax quality before the stress shift, or does it represent a
secondary readjustment? What is the relationship between the pattern
in stressed penultimates and in final unstressed syllables (where at
least high vowels seem to show an original length conditioning, at
least in Welsh)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is the complementary pattern of vowel and consonant length in
penultimate syllables, which is practically universal in Brythonic,
original, as implied by e.g.the classic account by Falc’hun (1951),
or is it a secondary development following stress shift?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I discuss the problems raised for these issues by traditional sources,
notably the focus on taxonomic phonemic transcription and the frequent
sidelining of consonant duration. I outline what kinds of studies are
needed to mitigate these problems. I also draw attention to some
evidence for the existence of dialects in Mid Wales that may lack a
tenseness distinction in at least some stressed syllables, and discuss
whether such systems can be accepted as evidence for the historically
secondary status of tenseness in penultimate stressed syllables.&lt;/p&gt;
