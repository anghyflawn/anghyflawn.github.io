    "text": "The key idea behind viewing size as a driver of phonological behaviour is that phonological activity corresponds to the presence of structure. Can we push this further?\n\nIf presence of structure is an explanatory factor and phonological activity is epiphenomenal, what justifies presence or absence of structure?\nWhere does phonological structure come from? What considerations, other than the patterns we are trying to explain, can support or militate against a representational proposal?\nThe story of western phonology as usually told (cf. Anderson 2021) begins with the realization that phonological structure is built because of lexical contrast. It is contrast that plays this external grounding role on which the edifice of phonology is later built: distinctions that are contrastive matter, those that are not are redundant, and phonologists should not care. Seen this way, was it a wise move to abandon this view, as generative phonology tried to do?"

We will focus especially on the two Eastern Kiranti languages Yakkha [yakk1236] and Yamphu [yamp1244]. Both are spoken by several thousand people (around or under 10,000), and are considered endangered.\nWe focus on data from verbal morphology. Characteristic of the Kiranti languages show a pattern of allomorphy within verbal paradigms in which a stem has two allomorphs, by and large distributed in phonologically conditioned ways; the forms given here are picked (sometimes constructed) to be representative of this conditioning.

We will explore the complexity beyond the neat phonological analyses in the literature.\n\nEach class will focus on one or two data sets, both those of a ‘sanitized’ kind common in phonology teaching (and literature) and those highlighting the complexity of the phenomena and the potential of alternative accounts that do not involve representations, or are not even phonological.
