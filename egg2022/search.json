    "text": "The key idea behind viewing size as a driver of phonological behaviour is that phonological activity corresponds to the presence of structure. Can we push this further?\n\nIf presence of structure is an explanatory factor and phonological activity is epiphenomenal, what justifies presence or absence of structure?\nWhere does phonological structure come from? What considerations, other than the patterns we are trying to explain, can support or militate against a representational proposal?\nThe story of western phonology as usually told (cf. Anderson 2021) begins with the realization that phonological structure is built because of lexical contrast. It is contrast that plays this external grounding role on which the edifice of phonology is later built: distinctions that are contrastive matter, those that are not are redundant, and phonologists should not care. Seen this way, was it a wise move to abandon this view, as generative phonology tried to do?"
