<p>Why does Gaelic matter? Does it, in fact, matter outside a nationalist narrative? It seems everyone in Scotland is now an expert on nationalism, with independence supporters always ready to accuse supporters of the Union of &lsquo;British nationalism&rsquo; and explaining the all-important difference between &lsquo;civic&rsquo; and &lsquo;ethnic&rsquo; nationalism. So where does Gaelic fit in? Stephen Daisley certainly appears to think it&rsquo;s part of the SNP&rsquo;s nation-building agenda to &lsquo;subsidize Gaelic into relevance&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Now I&rsquo;m going to lay my cards on the table. I live in Scotland, and intend to keep doing so (unless I&rsquo;m squeezed out by the tightening of immigration laws, but that&rsquo;s another story). I care about it because I live here. My 6-year-old daughter speaks with a Scottish accent, readily identifies as &lsquo;a Scottish girl, though I was born in Norway&rsquo;, and I won&rsquo;t be at all surprised if, when her first census comes around, she plumps for &lsquo;Scottish&rsquo;. And so I care about Scotland. But I&rsquo;m not Scottish. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ever be comfortable with personally identifying myself as &lsquo;Scottish&rsquo;. I&rsquo;m too acutely aware of the fact that I just don&rsquo;t have the same frame of reference as a Scottish person of my age. Listening to King Creosote&rsquo;s <em>From Scotland with Love</em>, I know, intellectually, what a weekend in Largs means, but I don&rsquo;t have the emotional connection.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have an ideological commitment to the cause of Scottish independence, in and of itself. I want this place to work for everyone who lives here, and if it can be made to work within a British state, I can&rsquo;t say I would get really exercised about it. So even though I might fit this inclusive civic nationalist story, as a &lsquo;new Scot&rsquo;, I don&rsquo;t really feel like one.</p>

<h2 id="gaelic-does-matter:c19b0f89fcc05627f84570861803bc35">Gaelic does matter</h2>

<p>And yet I feel quite strongly that Gaelic matters. And when I say &lsquo;feel&rsquo;, I mean it. It is not uncommon to see it defended on practical grounds. Gaelic creates jobs. It attracts tourists. And then there are the cognitive benefits of bilingualism. Learning a second language makes it easier to learn a third one. All that jazz.</p>

<p>Far be it from me to deny any of that (I am, after all, a card-carrying member of <a href="http://www.bilingualism-matters.org.uk">Bilingualism Matters</a>). But, in some ways, these instrumental arguments are problematic because they concede the point. Critics often complain that, for instance, bilingual signage is pointless, since everyone can read the English even when they&rsquo;re also Gaelic speakers. Defenders might point to the practical benefits instead. But why not embrace the symbolic importance of Gaelic railway station signs rather than apologetically skirt around it and move on to the &lsquo;real&rsquo; advantages? Bilingual signage contributes to normalizing the idea of Gaelic in the public sphere. And, indeed, the idea of bilingualism in the public sphere as such. It shows that the society is committed to visibly supporting everyone, including its minorities.</p>

<p>And this matters. Supporting Gaelic is not about some grand nation-building strategy. It&rsquo;s about the individual rights of real people. It&rsquo;s the grannies and grandpas in care homes all across the Lowlands who see their grasp of <em>Beurla</em> slipping as they approach old age. It&rsquo;s people who spoke Gaelic at home as children but were denied the opportunity to learn to read and write it because Gaelic-medium education is so new. It&rsquo;s about people who wish their grandparents weren&rsquo;t bounced by economic opportunity into not speaking their languages to their parents. Yes, it may be about feelings, but feelings matter, because well-being is not just about your socioeconomic background.</p>

<h2 id="beyond-gaelic:c19b0f89fcc05627f84570861803bc35">Beyond Gaelic</h2>

<p>And there&rsquo;s nothing specifically Gaelic about this. I don&rsquo;t see there&rsquo;s anything wrong with applying the same thinking to Scots &mdash; where there&rsquo;s a will there&rsquo;s a way. Nor, in fact, is there anything specifically Scottish. People&rsquo;s language rights matter. This applies to Lowlanders and Gaels and Poles and Germans. At the moment the Scottish powers that be don&rsquo;t really show all that much willingness to highlight and support multilingualism. As Malcolm Combe points out, the SNP&rsquo;s support for Gaelic, not to mention Scots, has actually been rather half-hearted. There is certainly no money bonanza and no Gaelic in every school.</p>

<p>Things are even worse for the non-Scottish languages. I find that people are invariably amazed when they learn about the scale of the Saturday morning language school operations across the UK. In Scotland, Russian speakers alone support at least a half-dozen Saturday schools with up to 80 children per school at any given time. The schools cater not just for more or less temporary migrants but also for local children from mixed families, for many of whom the school is really the only opportunity to discover that speaking Russian is not just that weird thing that your mom fancies doing for whatever reason. It&rsquo;s the same story for all the other languages spoken here.</p>

<p>The Saturday schools support Scottish children remaining bilingual. This is real human capital. And yet there is little support from the powers that be, no real targeted strategy. To the extent the schools get anything &mdash; and they&rsquo;re not really viable as commercial organizations &mdash; they get it from the cash-strapped councils along with other third-sector organizations. SQA has scrapped a range of language Highers (including Russian), citing lack of demand. But surely this supposed lack of demand is not unrelated to the rather clear lack of visible valuation of multilingualism? And I mean not warm words but real action. Instead of discontinuing the Highers &mdash; hitting both the native speakers without the opportunity to use their language much outside the home and the local kids learning the language at school &mdash; why not introduce instead a qualification for first-language speakers? Of course a native speaker will be bored by studying for an exam that tests your ability to order a coffee &mdash; give them something interesting, a real achievement to strive for.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s real rights for real people who live here, now. Not nation-building.</p>

<h2 id="not-just-tartan-tat:c19b0f89fcc05627f84570861803bc35">Not just tartan tat</h2>

<p>This is why Gaelic matters. If you want, it&rsquo;s the thin end of the wedge. Scotland has a long way to go in terms of making multilingualism non-remarkable. Up here we&rsquo;re years behind Wales, and Wales is nowhere near full normalization, as furores over the use(lessness) of Welsh still break out <a href="http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/private-school-head-apologises-unreservedly-9259226">with some regularity</a>. There is no constituency in Scottish society for defending individual language rights, because we can&rsquo;t even decide how much Gaelic we want.</p>

<p>A government that really wanted to make progress would not be afraid to press ahead with a big campaign to bring the language in. At the moment we have signs on some stations. For some, this is too much, because it doesn&rsquo;t serve a practical purpose. And it&rsquo;s true &mdash; it&rsquo;s too much if the function were purely informative but too little to be more than tokenism.</p>
